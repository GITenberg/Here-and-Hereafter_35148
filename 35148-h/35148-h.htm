<h2>MALA</h2>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>It was Saturday night at the end of a hard week.
I was just finishing my dinner when I was told
that a man wished to see me at once in the surgery.
The name, Tarn, was unknown to me.</p>

<p>I found a fair-haired man of thirty in a faded and
frayed suit of mustard-colour, holding in his hand
a broken straw hat. His face was rather fat and
roundish; his build powerful but paunchy. The
colour of face and hands showed open-air life and
work. His manner was slow, apathetic, heavy.
His speech was slow too, but it was the speech of an
educated man, and the voice was curiously gentle.</p>

<p>"My wife's ill, doctor. Can you come?"</p>

<p>"I can. What's the matter with her, Mr Tarn?"</p>

<p>He explained. I do not regard child-bearing as
illness, and told him so. I told him further that he
ought to have made his arrangements and to have
engaged a doctor and nurse beforehand.</p>

<p>"In her own country they do not regard it as illness
either. The women there do not have doctor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
or nurse. She did not wish it. But, however, as
she seemed to suffer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well. We'll get on. Where do you live?"</p>

<p>"Felonsdene."</p>

<p>"Eight miles away and right up on the downs.
Phew! Can I get my car there?"</p>

<p>"Most of the way at any rate&mdash;we could always
walk the rest."</p>

<p>"We'll chance it. I'll bring the car round.
Shan't keep you a minute, Mr Tarn."</p>

<p>I kept him rather longer than that. There were
the lamps to see to, and I had directions to give to
my servants. I did not take my driver with me.
He had been at work since eight in the morning.
When I re-entered the surgery I found Tarn still
standing in just the same pose and place, as if he
had not moved a hair's-breadth since I left him.</p>

<p>"Ready now," I said, as I picked up my bag.</p>

<p>He took out a pinch of sovereigns from his waistcoat-pocket,
seven or eight of them.</p>

<p>"Your fee, doctor," he said.</p>

<p>"That can wait until I've done my work. Come
along. Shall I lend you an overcoat?"</p>

<p>He thanked me but refused it, saying that he was
used to all weathers. The night was fairly warm
too. He sat beside me on the front seat. The first
six miles were easy enough along a good road, and
I talked to him as I drove. I omit the professional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
part of our conversation&mdash;the questions which a
doctor would naturally put on such an occasion.</p>

<p>"So your wife's a foreigner," I said. "What
nationality?"</p>

<p>"She is a woman of colour&mdash;a negress."</p>

<p>It is true that all coloured people inspire me with
a feeling of physical repulsion, and equally true that
I can set all feelings of repulsion aside when there is
work to be done.</p>

<p>"Ah!" I said. "And you live up at Felonsdene.
To tell the truth, I didn't know anybody lived there.
I remember the place&mdash;came on it two years ago or
more when I was roaming over the downs. There
was a farm-house all in ruins&mdash;and, let me see, was
there a cottage? I didn't come upon anybody living
there then. I remember that, because I was thirsty
after my walk and couldn't get a drink."</p>

<p>"There was no one there then, and there is no
cottage. We came last year. Part of the farm-house
has been repaired."</p>

<p>"Well, you've struck about the loneliest spot in
England. Who's your landlord?"</p>

<p>"Eh? It's mine&mdash;I bought it. Two acres and the
farm-house. Had trouble to get it&mdash;a deal of trouble."</p>

<p>"And who's with your wife now?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Nobody. She's alone in the house."</p>

<p>"Well, that's not right," I said.</p>

<p>"We have no servants&mdash;do everything ourselves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
The nearest house is a farmer's at Sandene, three
miles away, and we've had no dealings with him.
It couldn't be helped, and&mdash;she's different, you know.
I was not long in coming to you. I caught the mail-cart
as soon as I reached the road, and got a lift."</p>

<p>"Still, I'm thinking&mdash;how am I to get on?"</p>

<p>"You'll find I can do anything a woman can do,
and do it better. I am more intelligent and I have
no nerves. You must pull up at the next gate,
doctor. We strike across the downs there."</p>

<p>We had done the six miles, mostly up hill, in twenty-one
minutes. Now we turned through the gate,
along a turf track deeply rutted. Luckily the
weather had been dry for the last fortnight. We
crawled up to the top of the crest and then along it
for a mile. I saw lights ahead in a hollow below.
A dog barked savagely.</p>

<p>"That Felonsdene?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That's it. The descent is bad."</p>

<p>When I got to it I found that it was very bad. I
stopped the engines.</p>

<p>"If we break our necks we shan't be much use,"
I said. "I'll leave the car here. There's nobody
to run away with it."</p>

<p>"Shall we take a lamp?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Better."</p>

<p>He picked up my bag, unhitched one lamp, and
extinguished the other, while I spread the rug over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the seats. His ordinary slowness was deceptive.
When he was actually doing something he was remarkably
quick without being hurried. He was
quick too in seeing a mechanical device&mdash;that was
clear from the way he handled the lamps. We
began the brief descent, and the dog barked more
furiously than ever.</p>

<p>"Is that dog loose?" I asked, as we neared the
house.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "But he's educated. He'd kill
a stranger who came alone; he won't touch you."</p>

<p>He gave a whistle and the barking stopped. The
dog, an enormous black retriever, came running
towards us; his eyes in the lamplight had a liquid
trustfulness.</p>

<p>"Heel," said Tarn sharply, and the dog paced
quietly behind him, taking no notice of me whatever.</p>

<p>We went through a yard surrounded by a wall of
rough stone. By the light of the lamp I saw that
the wall had been mended in places. There was a
rough shed on the left, with crates and packing-cases
under it. The front door was flush with the wall of
the house. It was unlocked, and when Tarn opened
it a bright light streamed out. Within was a small
square hall, and I noticed that the light was incandescent
gas.</p>

<p>Tarn saw that I had noticed it. "I put in a gas-plant,"
he said. "Will you come this way?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>He took me into a great living-room. I should
think it was about forty feet by twenty. There
was a big open fireplace at the further end of the
room. The floor was flagged, without rugs or carpets.
The walls were the same inside as out, rough
stone and mortar; there were three small windows
high up in the walls. The windows were newly
glazed, the walls had been repaired. There was
very little furniture&mdash;three wooden windsor chairs,
a couple of deal tables, and some cupboards made
from packing-cases. There was no attempt at ornament
or decoration of any kind, and there was no
disorder. The scanty furniture was precisely arranged,
nothing was left lying about, and everything
was scrupulously clean. The timbers of the
pointed roof seemed to me to be new. The room
was very brightly lit, with more gas jets (of the
cheapest description) than were needed.</p>

<p>What struck me most was the smell of the place&mdash;a
smoky, greenish, sub-acid, slightly aromatic
smell. I wondered if it could come from the great
logs that smouldered in the fireplace, before which
the retriever now stretched himself.</p>

<p>"Queer smell here," I said. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"It comes," he said, "from the smoke of juniper
leaves."</p>

<p>"You don't burn those in the fireplace, do you?"</p>

<p>"No. I&mdash;I don't think you'd understand."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>The words were said gently, almost sadly, without
offensive intention. But they annoyed me a little&mdash;I
did not like to be told by this scarecrow that I
could not understand.</p>

<p>"Very well," I said. "Now then, where's your
wife?"</p>

<p>He pointed to a door at the further end of the
room, on the right of the fireplace. "Through there,"
he said. "I&mdash;I don't know if you speak French."</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Mala speaks French more easily than English. She
lived for many years in Paris&mdash;was born there. You'll
find in that room the things a chemist in Helmstone
thought might be wanted. If you need anything
else, or want my help in any way, I shall be here."</p>

<p>"Good," I said, and passed through the door he
had indicated.</p>

<p>I must remember that I am not writing for doctors.
All I need say of the case is that it was a good thing
Tarn fetched me. It was a case where the intervention
of a medical man was imperatively necessary.
Otherwise all went perfectly well. The child was
born in a little more than an hour after my arrival,
a girl, healthy and vigorous, and as black as the ace
of spades. Tarn did all that was required of him
perfectly&mdash;quickly, but without noise or hurry, and
with great intelligence.</p>

<p>Mala, his wife, seemed to me to be very young. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
was a girl of splendid physique; her face, like the
face of every negress, repelled me. She showed
affection for her child, and expressed her intention
of nursing it herself, of which she seemed capable.
This was all natural&mdash;more natural than normal
unfortunately&mdash;but all the time I was conscious that
I was attending a woman of morbid psychology.
When I left her asleep, it was to join a man of morbid
psychology in the great living-room.</p>

<p>"All well?" asked Tarn, as I entered.</p>

<p>"Quite. Both asleep." My body was tired, and
I dare say I ought to have been sleepy myself, but
my mind was awake and alert. The unusual nature
of the experience may account for it. I sat down
and gave him some instructions and advice about his
wife, to which he paid close attention.</p>

<p>"Must you come here again?" he asked. I thought
it a question that might have been better expressed.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "I don't want to pile up the visits,
but I must do what's wanted."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that. I meant that unless you
were coming again in any case, I should have to
make arrangements for fetching you if the need arose."</p>

<p>I laughed. "Arrangements? Well, you've nobody
to send but yourself?"</p>

<p>"There's the dog."</p>

<p>"But he doesn't know where I live."</p>

<p>"I was meaning to teach him that to-morrow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
I'd better do it in any case&mdash;one never knows what
may happen." He sighed profoundly.</p>

<p>"Teach him to fetch the doctor&mdash;eh? He must
be a clever beggar. What do you call him?"</p>

<p>"He has no name. He's not a pet. You must
take some refreshment before you go. Whisky?"</p>

<p>"Ah, a drop of whisky and a biscuit would be
rather welcome. Thanks."</p>

<p>He brought out a jar of whisky, a gasogen of soda-water,
and some large hard biscuits in their native tin.</p>

<p>"To your daughter's health," I said, as I raised
my glass.</p>

<p>He suddenly put his glass down. "Farce," he
said savagely. "But it's all farce&mdash;this&mdash;this fuss,
She's born to die, isn't she? It's the common lot.
She's hauled out of nothing by blind Chance, to be
tossed back into nothing by blind Chance. Drink
the health of the seaweed that the tide throws up
on the shore and the tide sucks back again? No!
Not I!"</p>

<p>The whole thing had been so strange that this outbreak
did not particularly astonish me. "You'd
be a happier man, Mr Tarn, and a more sensible man,
if you would simply accept Nature as you find it.
You can't alter it and you can't understand it.
You're beating your head against a wall."</p>

<p>This ragged fellow took on an air of superiority that
annoyed me. "Yes, yes," he said. "I've heard all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
that&mdash;and so often. It's the point of view of ordinary
materialistic science. You are not a religious man."</p>

<p>"Certainly," I said, "I don't pretend that I know
what I do not know. Nor am I fool enough, Mr
Tarn, to complain of what from insufficient data I
am unable to understand. Put in other words, I
am neither an orthodox believer nor an atheist.
Do I understand that you are a religious man
yourself?"</p>

<p>"The religion of Mala and her people is mine."</p>

<p>"Really? You turn the tables on the missionaries.
Well, the theological discussion is interesting but it
is often interminable; and I have work to do to-morrow.
I must be getting on."</p>

<p>"I will come with you as far as the car. But
first, doctor, the dog must learn that you are welcome
here and that he is never to harm you. Call him
and give him a bit of biscuit."</p>

<p>I called him. He looked up from his place before
the fire but did not move. Then Tarn made a movement
with his hand, and the dog got up, shook himself,
and walked slowly towards me. He went all round
me, sniffing. I held out the biscuit to him, and he
looked away to his master and whined. Tarn nodded,
and the dog immediately took the food from my hand.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tarn, as if answering what I was thinking,
"he has never been allowed to take food from any
hand but mine. He will never forget you. You can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
come here at any hour of the day or night now with
perfect safety. It's&mdash;it's the freedom of the city."</p>

<p>As Tarn climbed with me up to the car, he spoke
again on the subject of my fee. "I suppose I should
not have offered it in advance," he said. "But it
occurred to me that, as I never think about clothes,
I looked very poor, and that the place where I have
chosen to live also looked very poor. And you did
not know me. As a matter of fact, I am bothered
with far more money than I want."</p>

<p>"Ah!" I laughed. "I could do with a little worry
of that sort."</p>

<p>As he fixed up the lamps he thanked me warmly
for what I had done for Mala, and asked what time
he might expect me on the morrow. I opened my
pocket-book and looked at it by the light of the lamp.
"Well, I've a light day to-morrow, barring accidents.
I shall be here some time in the afternoon."</p>

<p>The drive home was accomplished without incident.
I ran the car into the coach-house and
went straight to bed. But for more than an hour I
could not get to sleep. I was haunted by that man
and his negress wife, building theories about them,
trying to account for them. Just as I was dropping
off I was awakened again by a smell of bitter smoke
in my nostrils&mdash;the smell of burning juniper leaves.
Then I recognised that the smell was a memory-illusion,
and fell asleep in real earnest.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>I got back from my Sunday morning round before
one. Helmstone was rather full of visitors that
day, and there were many cars before the big hotel
in the Queen's Road. As my man was driving
slowly through the traffic I saw, a hundred yards
away, Tarn striding along, in the same shabby clothes,
with his retriever at his heel. He turned down a
side-street, and I saw no more of him. On inquiry
I found that he had not called at my house. He
had merely been there, as he said, to give the dog
his lesson.</p>

<p>I am a bachelor. I lunched alone on cold beef
and beer, and I read the <i>Lancet</i>. I intended to remain
materialistic and scientific, and not to be infected
by that air of mystery and morbidity which
seemed to hang round Tarn and his negress wife at
Felonsdene. I had not been in practice for ten years
without coming on strange occurrences before, and
they had all lost their strangeness when the facts
had been filled in. My after-luncheon visit to
Felonsdene was of course professional, but if I had
any chance I meant to satisfy an ordinary lay curiosity
as well.</p>

<p>I drove myself, and the track across the downs
looked worse in daylight than it had done by night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Still it seemed reasonable to suppose that what the
car had done then it could do now. I could see more
clearly now what had been done in the way of repairs
to that ruined and long-deserted farm-house. The
pointed roof over the big room where I had sat the
night before had been mended and made weather-tight.
The chimney-stack was new, and so were
the window-casements. Adjoining the big room
was a building of irregular shape that might possibly
have contained three or four other rooms, roofed
with new corrugated iron. One or two outbuildings
looked as if they had been newly constructed from
old materials. But that part of the farm-house
which had originally been two-storied had been left
quite untouched. Half the roof of it was down, the
windows were without glass, and one saw through
them the broken stairs and torn wall-paper peeling
off and flapping in the brisk March breeze. On the
grass-field beyond the court-yard two good Alderney
cows were grazing. Most of the land looked
neglected; but Tarn had no help and had everything
to do himself. An orchard of stunted and
miserable-looking fruit trees was sheltered by a dip
of the land from north and east.</p>

<p>The dog barked furiously when he heard my car,
and before I began the climb down to the farm-house
I picked up two or three flints with intent to use
them if he went for me. But all signs of hostility<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
vanished when he saw me. He did not leap and
gambol for joy, but he thrust his nose into my hand
and then walked just in front of me, wagging his
tail, and looking back from time to time to see that
I understood and was following him.</p>

<p>He led the way across the court-yard, through the
open outer door, and across the hall to the door of
the big room. He scratched at the door. From
impatience I knocked and entered.</p>

<p>Tarn had fallen asleep before the fire in one of the
windsor chairs. He was just rousing himself as I
entered. He had taken off his coat and his heavy boots
and wore felt slippers that had a home-made look.
From the table beside him it appeared that he had
lunched frugally on whisky, milk and hard biscuits.</p>

<p>"Sorry I was asleep," he said. "But the dog knew."</p>

<p>"Ah!" I said. "You'd a long walk this morning.
I saw you at Helmstone."</p>

<p>"Yes. I told you."</p>

<p>"You should have come into my house for a rest.
How's your wife getting on&mdash;had a good night?"</p>

<p>"It seems so. She has slept a long time. So
has the child. I will find out if she will see you."
He passed into the inner room.</p>

<p>If she had expressed any disinclination to see me I
should have been extremely angry; also, I might have
thought it right to disregard the disinclination. But
Tarn reappeared almost directly and asked me to go in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>I found that all was going as well as possible both
with her and with the child. She really was a
splendid animal, unhurt either by excessive work
or&mdash;as many modern mothers are&mdash;by a rotten
fashionable life. With me she was reticent, almost
sullen in manner; yet she seemed docile and had
carried out my orders. The only difficulty was, as
I had expected, to get her to remain in bed. With
her child she showed white teeth in ecstasies of
maternal joy. Before I had finished with her I
heard the rain pattering on the iron roof of her
room.</p>

<p>I went back into the great living-room. It was
rather dark there, for the sky was heavily clouded
and the windows, placed high up, gave but little
light. The table had been cleared, and Tarn was
not there. I sat down to wait for him, and the dog
got up from the fire and came over to me and laid
his head on my knee. He was an enormous and
very powerful brute, as much retriever as anything,
but evidently with another strain in his composition.
I felt quite safe with him now, talked to him and
patted him&mdash;attentions which he received gravely,
without resistance but without any signs of pleasure.</p>

<p>Presently Tarn came in from outside. His hair
was wet with the rain.</p>

<p>"I've taken up a tarpaulin," he said, "and thrown
it over your car, doctor."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's very good of you," I said. "I was just
doubting if that rug of mine would be enough."</p>

<p>"It comes down heavily. You must remain here
awhile, unless you have other patients whom you
must see at once."</p>

<p>"No," I said. "This finishes my work for to-day,
I hope. I always try to arrange for Sunday
afternoon free, and I'm glad to accept your hospitality.
No juniper smoke to-day."</p>

<p>"There has been&mdash;no occasion." He went on
quickly to inquire about his wife and child. He
was not a man who showed his emotions much, but he
certainly left me with the impression that he was fond
and proud of the child. He asked several questions
about her as he went round the room, lighting the gas-jets.
Then we sat before the log fire and lit our pipes.</p>

<p>"One's a little surprised to find gas in a place like
this," I said.</p>

<p>"It makes less work than lamps. When one tries
to be independent and do the work oneself that's
a consideration. Besides, it gives more light, and
people who live alone as we do need plenty of light.
I'm afraid it must all seem rather puzzling."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "I don't want to be curious."</p>

<p>"And I don't want to puzzle anybody, nor to
enlighten anybody either. Still, you've done much
for us&mdash;Mala says she would have died but for you.
If you care for a very simple story you can have it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just as you like," I said. "But I should imagine
that your story would be interesting."</p>

<p>"I do not think so. A little more than a year ago
I was in Paris. Mala was also there. I met her
through a friend of mine. I brought her to England
and married her. You know how such a marriage
is regarded here&mdash;how a woman of colour is regarded
in any case. Very well, Felonsdene was a place
where we could live to ourselves."</p>

<p>He stopped, as if there had been no more to say.</p>

<p>"So far," I said, "you have told me precisely
what one might have conjectured. How did it all
happen? What were you doing in Paris&mdash;and Mala?
Who was the friend? How did it come about?"</p>

<p>He spoke slowly, more to himself, as it seemed,
than to me. "My friend was an English Catholic,
an ex-priest, a religious man like myself. His mind
gave way, and he is shut up in an asylum now. He
took me to see Mala. Night after night. Sometimes
it was miraculous&mdash;and sometimes nothing.
When the performance went badly, the uncle beat
her. We could stop that because it was only a
question of money. I remember it all&mdash;settled
after midnight at a <i>caf&eacute;</i> where we drank absinthe&mdash;the
uncle with arms too long and very prognathous,
like a dressed-up ape, pouncing on the bank-notes
with hairy fingers and counting aloud in French,
very bad French, not like Mala's. He was very old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>&mdash;a
hundred years, he said&mdash;he cannot have been
her uncle really. A great-uncle perhaps. He was
not a religious man at all. He kept patting the
pocket where the bank-notes were. We put him
in a fiacre, because he was drunk. We were out of
Paris that night&mdash;my friend, and Mala, and myself.
Next morning we crossed the Channel, and next
night there was a riot at the theatre because Mala
did not appear. Did I say where we went in England?
I am not used to speaking so much, and it
confuses me."</p>

<p>I was afraid he would stop again. "I don't think
you mentioned the exact name," I said.</p>

<p>"Wilsing, my friend's own place. High walls,
and lonely gardens, but too many servants&mdash;they
all looked questions at us. Gardeners would touch
their caps and look round after we had passed&mdash;you
can imagine it. It was while we were at Wilsing
that I married Mala. And shortly afterwards my
poor friend had to be taken away. You see, doctor,
he was a very earnest man, and very religious. He
had gone too far along a new road, and he was
horribly frightened but could not go back. It was
too much for him. Mala and I had to go away also,
of course. I remember hotels that would not take
us in. We have been followed in the streets by jeering
crowds. Even when I had found Felonsdene
there was endless trouble before I could buy it. No<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
tenant could be found for it&mdash;there is some silly
story that the place is haunted. Besides, the house
was all in ruins, and too far from&mdash;from everything.
And yet the owner would not sell."</p>

<p>He paused. "And in the end?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I got it in the end. I tempted him.
Here we have arranged life as we wish it to be,
and we practise our religion without molestation.
There are consolations."</p>

<p>"The consolations of religion," I suggested.</p>

<p>Suddenly he put down his pipe and stood up erect.
He stretched an arm out clumsily towards me. His
eyes flashed under the bright gas-jets, and his nostrils
quivered. He spoke in a low voice but with the
most intense emphasis. "You don't know what
you're saying. In our religion there are no consolations.
There is only propitiation, and again propitiation,
and always propitiation&mdash;the sacrifice of
more and more as the end draws nearer." He
swept his arm round and pointed at the door of his
wife's room. "What consolation is there from the
Power that there&mdash;in there, where you have
been&mdash;linked love with life only to link life
with death again? What consolation from the
Power that has closed and sealed the door of
knowledge?"</p>

<p>He sat down and remained silent. I was beginning
to form some conclusions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then what consolations have you?"</p>

<p>"Linked to bitterness and yet something. For
example&mdash;I have Mala."</p>

<p>"Your child also."</p>

<p>"Yes, the child too. For a little time perhaps."</p>

<p>There was again a pause. The rain had cleared
now and I rose to go. "Mr Tarn," I said, "before
I leave you I think it my duty as a doctor to tell
you something."</p>

<p>"About Mala?" he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"About yourself." He laughed contemptuously.
"If you go on with your present manner of life I
will not answer for the consequences. I think you
are playing, and have been playing, a very dangerous
game; the case of your own friend warns you
how dangerous it is. This prolonged solitude is
bad for you and bad for your wife. This pessimistic
brooding over things you cannot understand&mdash;which
you are pleased to call a religion&mdash;is worse still,
especially if it is accompanied by any rites or ceremonies
which might impress a morbid imagination.
I'm not going to mince matters&mdash;if you don't give
this up you'll lose your reason."</p>

<p>"What is it you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"Do not be so absurdly sensitive about the fact
that you have married a negress. Be a man and not
a baby. Go and live in some village and mix with
your fellow-men. No novelty lasts more than three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
months. Before the end of that time your wife will
excite no attention at all&mdash;the position will be accepted.
And if you can't find any better religion
than the dismal rubbish that is poisoning your mind
at present, then have none at all. It will be better
for you."</p>

<p>"It is impossible to take your advice," he said
stolidly.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because Mala and I are as we were made. We
won't argue it."</p>

<p>"Please yourself. I've done my duty. Good-bye,
Mr Tarn."</p>

<p>He told me that he was coming with me to the
road. The very thin skin of turf on the hard rock
of the crest of the hill would be so greasy that the
wheels of my car would go round ineffectively and
refuse to bite without his weight on the back axle.
At the rutty descent on the other side he would get
off and walk by the car to lend a hand if the wheels
sank too deep in the mud there. His predictions
happened exactly, and I was very glad of his help.
At the road he left me; up on the hill his dog guarded
the tarpaulin and waited for his return.</p>

<p>Certainly, in some simple practical matters the
man was still showing himself sane and shrewd
enough.</p>

<p>I dined that night with a bachelor friend in Helm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>stone
who has a good reference library and a vast
fund of curious information. He told me to what
Power the smell of burning juniper was supposed
to be agreeable. He also informed me that Wilsing
was the Herefordshire seat of the Earl of Deljeon.</p>

<p>"Poor beggar!" added my host.</p>

<p>"Deljeon?" I asked. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well&mdash;he's in an asylum, you know. And
likely to stop there, so they say."</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>I happened in the course of the next week to hear
of Tarn from another source.</p>

<p>Tarn had told me that his next neighbour was the
farmer at Sandene, three miles away, and that they
had had no dealings together. Now I knew little
Perrot, the farmer at Sandene, very well. I had
attended his robust and prolific wife on three natural
occasions, I had seen the children through measles,
I had done what I could for the chronic dyspepsia
of his termagant aunt, I had looked after Perrot's
knee when a horse kicked him. Perrot was a ferret-faced
man, a hard man at a bargain and a very good
man on a horse. Between farming and horse-coping
he did very fairly well. He was the willing and
abject slave of his wife and his numerous children.
He was interested in medical matters, of which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
had no knowledge whatever, and relished an occasional
long word. So I was not surprised to receive
a note from Perrot stating "our Gladys seems to
have omphitis," that he would be glad if I could
call, and that he was my obedient servant. Tommy,
the brother of Gladys, took back my verbal answer
that I would call that morning.</p>

<p>Sandene resembles Felonsdene in that both are
hollows in the downs, and resembles it in no other
respect. Sandene is approached by a definite and
well-made road. Its farm-house and little group
of cottages have a cheerful and human look. The
inhabitants are busy folk, but they find time to
whistle and to laugh. Gladys Perrot, I found, was
suffering from a diet of which the nature and extent
had been dictated by enthusiasm rather than by
judgment. I was able to say definitely that she
would soon recover.</p>

<p>Perrot came in from trouble with a chaff-cutter
to have a few words with me.</p>

<p>"So it's not omphitis?" he said with an air of
relief.</p>

<p>"I should say it was a slight bilious attack. But
I don't know what omphitis is."</p>

<p>"All I can say is that my poor grandmother died
of it. Buried thirty-six hours afterwards&mdash;had to
be. Makes one careful. That's why I sent Tom
down. He had cake at your place, he said. If he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
asked for it, I shall have to pay him, to learn him
manners."</p>

<p>I acquitted Tom. "No," I said, "that was my
old housekeeper&mdash;trying to make a job for me."</p>

<p>Perrot saluted the veteran joke heartily.</p>

<p>"I was up with your neighbours at Felonsdene
the other day," I said.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Perrot, grimly. "Man ill?"</p>

<p>"No. His wife's just got a baby."</p>

<p>"And you attended her. Very good of you.
Vet's work I should have called that."</p>

<p>"You don't know them, do you?"</p>

<p>"Nor want. Not but what he and his dog did
me a good turn once. If you like to take the message,
sir, you can tell Tarn that Mr Perrot of Sandene
would be glad to give him five sovereigns for that dog.
So I would too, and not think twice about it."</p>

<p>"I'll tell him," I said. "What was the good turn?"</p>

<p>"I lost a couple of sheep. And that annoyed me,
though they were marked and pretty sure to be
brought back some time. Still I was annoyed that
night, you ask the missus if I wasn't."</p>

<p>"Like a bear with a sore head," said Mrs Perrot
cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Well, at half-past nine I was just on going up to
bed, when there came a great barking outside and a
scratching at the door. It wasn't one of my dogs,
I knew, though you may be sure they very soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
chipped in. I went out, and there were my two
sheep and Tarn's big dog with them. Those sheep
hadn't been hurried and scurried neither. They'd
been brought in nicely. The dog wouldn't let me
get near him. He was what might be called truculent,
as some of the best of them are. He was away
again before you could say knife."</p>

<p>"He's no sheep-dog," said Mrs Perrot. "Five
pounds for the likes of him! What would you say
if I talked like that?"</p>

<p>"To my mind," said Perrot, stolidly, "a sheep-dog
is a dog that's clever and reliable at handling
sheep, and I don't care what the breed is&mdash;I don't
care if he's a poodle. Come to that, Tarn's dog
looks like a cross between a retriever and a&mdash;a elephant.
All the same, he'd be worth five sovereigns
to me, and I'd back my judgment too. Tell you
why. I expected there was somebody with the
dog and I wanted to do the right thing&mdash;a drink for
a master or sixpence for his man&mdash;and I gave a
hulloa. There was nobody within call, for I went
right out and looked. He'd been sent in by himself,
and he'd made no mistake. That's no ordinary dog."</p>

<p>"No," I said, "he's not. I know him. He's
rather a friend of mine."</p>

<p>"There&mdash;and the missus says he's more like some
wild beast. Oh, they're all right when they've got
to know you, dogs are."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Perrot followed me out to the car. "There's
rather a queer thing," he said, "but I know the
medical etiquette&mdash;doctors aren't supposed to talk."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "they're often supposed to talk,
but they don't do it."</p>

<p>"Then you can't tell me anything about that&mdash;I
don't know what to call it&mdash;tabernacle, perhaps&mdash;at
Felonsdene."</p>

<p>"I've seen nothing of the kind, nor heard of it
either. What do you mean?"</p>

<p>Perrot could only tell me what Ball had told him.
Ball was a labourer whom Perrot employed. Late
in the previous October, on a Saturday morning, Ball
had gone in to Helmstone to deliver a horse that
Perrot had sold, and drew his wages before he went.
He rode the horse in and was to walk back. The
purchaser of the horse gave Ball a pint. A friend
whom he met by chance gave Ball a quart. A few
minutes later Ball gave himself another quart,
because he could afford it, and started for home.
A carter who gave him a lift told him that he was
drunk, and though Ball did not accept the theory
completely he thought there might be something
to be said for it. It seemed better to him to roam
the downs for a couple of hours before he faced the
inquisitorial glance of Mrs Ball. When he reached
Felonsdene he sat down to rest under some gorse
near the crest of the downs before tackling the three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
miles home to Sandene. He fell asleep, and when
he woke, shivering with cold, it was midnight. But
he maintained that it was not the cold which woke
him; it was music of a sort. There was a drum
beating, not loud, but regularly. At intervals a
woman's voice was heard singing. "Stopping short
and then starting in again on it" was Ball's phrase
to describe it. The sounds came from what looked
like an outhouse; it had no windows, but light
streamed out from the open door. And in the path
of the light there was a grey smoke. He crept very
quietly and cautiously down to a point from which he
might see what was going on in there. The inside
of the building was filled with the grey smoke, but
through it he could see many lighted candles, candles
as long as your arm, and a kneeling figure&mdash;he could
not say whether it was man or woman&mdash;in a long
red garment. The singing and drum-beating had
stopped and all was quite still. Then Ball's foot
slipped and sent stones rattling down. The next
minute Ball was running for his life with, so he
maintained, Tarn's dog after him.</p>

<p>As Ball got away, it may be believed that either
the dog was chained, or that it was called off immediately
by Tarn himself.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you make of it, sir, but it
looks to me as if those Tarns were Romans," said
Perrot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr Perrot," I said, "it doesn't do to take
much notice of what a fuddled man thinks he
sees."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said Perrot. "Anyway, it gave
Ball a good scare&mdash;he's been teetotal ever since
and talks of joining the Plymouth Brethren."</p>

<p>Within a brief period from that day my visits to
Felonsdene ceased; there was no longer any reason
for them. Tarn accepted all that the law required;
he registered the birth of the child and he had her
vaccinated. The devotion of Mala and himself to
that child was beyond all question.</p>

<p>I repeated the very good advice which I had
already given him, but he refused to follow it. I
think he considered that he had already said too
much, and he quite obviously attempted to minimise
it. He said that perhaps he had expressed
himself too strongly. It was quite possible for a
small family to live happily and cheerfully together
even in so desolate a spot as Felonsdene. There
was plenty to do. Mala had her baby and the house
to look after. He had the outdoor work. If he
wanted to see what the rest of the world was doing,
he could always go into Helmstone; there were
plenty of hotels there where he could get a drink
and a game of billiards. When I told him what
Ball professed to have seen and heard he got rather
angry. It was all a lie. Ball had never been near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the place. But a few minutes afterwards he said:
"I wish I'd let the dog get him."</p>

<p>It was all intended to be very reassuring. But
it was not candid and it was vaguely disquieting.
It occurred to me to pay a visit one night secretly
to Felonsdene to see if I could make out what was
going on. But my practice in Helmstone was too
heavy to leave leisure for nocturnal expeditions of
that sort; besides, it was no business of mine.</p>

<p>Tarn paid my bill&mdash;he wanted to pay twice as
much&mdash;and I regarded the incident as closed. If
I were called in again I thought it likely that it
would be to certify the lunacy of either Tarn or his
wife.</p>

<p>But the incident was reopened a little less than a
year later, and not in the way that I had expected.</p>

<h4>IV</h4>


<p>In the following January I took a partner in my
practice. This was a step which I had long
contemplated. I was a bachelor, making far too
much money for my simple needs and working far
too hard in order to accomplish it. I also wanted
time for my investigations into the cause and treatment
of a certain disease; these investigations have
nothing to do with the story of Mala and her husband
and would not interest laymen. I have no excuse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
but vanity for adding that they subsequently brought
me some reputation. My partner was a sound and
able young man, much interested in his profession,
and soon made himself liked and respected. My
life became much easier and more comfortable.</p>

<p>In the March following, about four one morning,
I was awakened by the barking of a dog in the street
outside my house. Presently I heard him scratching
at my door. I hurried down, switched on the lights,
and opened the door. I had thought of damage to
my paint and not of Tarn, of whom I had heard
nothing for a long time. But it was Tarn's dog that
lay on the pavement outside.</p>

<p>I supposed at first that somebody at Felonsdene
was ill, and that the dog had been sent to fetch me.
But the dog's appearance did not bear this out. He
had evidently come much further than the distance
from Felonsdene to my house. He got up when he
saw me, but the poor brute was so exhausted that
he could hardly stand, and he looked as if he had been
starved for days. I called him into the house and
got food for him; he ate ravenously. I waited to
see if he would try to get out again, but he seemed
perfectly content to remain where he was. Finally,
he followed me upstairs to my own room, where he
stretched himself on the hearth-rug and almost
instantly fell asleep. I was just about to switch
off the light and get back into my bed again when I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
noticed the shining brass plate on the dog's collar.
I bent down and examined it. On the brass plate,
neatly engraved, were my own name and address.
It looked as if the dog were to be mine in future.
But why? What had happened?</p>

<p>The dog established definitely his relations with
the rest of my household next morning. He took
no notice whatever of anybody who left him alone.
But he would allow nobody but myself to touch him.
Even my partner, who understood dogs and was
fond of them, had to confess himself beaten. He
was taking the round that morning, and I intended
to walk up to Felonsdene with the dog. But the
poor brute was still so stiff and footsore that I decided
after all to take the car. He sat beside me,
and I rather think that he knew where he was going.
But he showed no excitement when the car stopped,
and made no attempt to rush off to the farm-house.
He followed me quietly down the hill.</p>

<p>A saddled horse was tethered in the court-yard,
and the outer door was open. In the hall stood Mr
Perrot with a penny note-book and a stumpy pencil
in his hand. He looked up as he heard my step,
and greeted me with his usual heartiness.</p>

<p>"This is a surprise, Mr Perrot," I said. "I didn't
expect to find you here. I was looking for Tarn."</p>

<p>"Afraid you won't find him, sir. They all cleared
out yesterday morning. I've bought this place."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bought it?"</p>

<p>"House and land, furniture and stock, everything
except the dog and their clothes. It's a little speculation
of mine, and looks like being a very good
speculation too. I knew you were going to have
the dog&mdash;he told me he meant him as a present to
you, and according to Tarn I could never have done
anything with him. Truculent&mdash;too truculent."</p>

<p>"I didn't know he was leaving. How did it come
about?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he came round one morning three weeks
ago, and asked me if I'd buy his place. I said I'd
buy that or anything else if the price were right.
And it was right enough because it was my own
price; I came and went over everything and said
what I'd give, and he never haggled. I paid my
ten per cent. next day, and completed at the lawyer's
in Helmstone afternoon before last."</p>

<p>"Tarn was there?"</p>

<p>"He was. What's more, we had a bottle of
champagne wine at the Armada afterwards at his
expense, and he drove me back to Sandene in his
car."</p>

<p>"Car? I never knew he'd got one."</p>

<p>"Only had it two months, he said. It's a bigger
one than yours, sir, and I expect he'll lose money on
it. For he told me he shouldn't take it over to
France with him, and they're bad things to sell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Yes, I felt like one of the gentlefolk that afternoon&mdash;drinking
champagne wine and sitting in a motor-car.
He must be a warmer man than ever I supposed."</p>

<p>"How was he looking?"</p>

<p>"Well, he was quiet, and yet he was a bit excited,
if you know what I mean. He'd new clothes on&mdash;oh,
quite the thing. It's my belief that he's come
into money unexpected, and that he and the two
niggers&mdash;the wife and baby&mdash;are off on a jaunt
together."</p>

<p>I did not share Perrot's belief, but I said nothing.</p>

<p>"In France they're not too particular, so I'm
told," said Perrot. "I daresay niggers go down
better there than they do here."</p>

<p>"Did you see the woman and her baby when you
were here?"</p>

<p>"No, they weren't shown, and I didn't ask for
them. I don't think they were in the house when I
came, for I went into each room. But they must
have come in by another way before I left, for I
heard them in the next room to us. What's more,
the baby was laughing and the woman was sobbing."</p>

<p>"What was she crying about?"</p>

<p>Perrot laughed. "Why, women will cry for anything.
Toothache perhaps. Maybe he'd been giving
her a bit of a dressing-down."</p>

<p>I did not agree with Perrot's conclusions, but
again I made no comment. Perrot had to get on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
his horse and ride back to Sandene. He confided
to me that he'd got a tenant for Felonsdene already.
Mrs Lane was going to live there with her married
daughter and her son-in-law. Mrs Lane was Perrot's
bad-tempered and dyspeptic aunt, and so far she
had lived in Perrot's house at Sandene. "But I
haven't got room for her any longer," said Perrot.
"So she's taking her <i>exeatus</i>." I recommend
<i>exeatus</i> to the philologist.</p>

<p>Perrot had ridden off, and I was half-way up the
hill to my car, when the idea struck me that I should
like to have a look at the building which had been
used for the curious rites that Ball had described
and I turned back again. I found the place; it
stood apart from the house, and was boarded on the
inside. That curious smell of bitter smoke still
hung about it. At one end I could see that some
sort of fitment had been removed, and there were
splashes of candle-wax on the floor.</p>

<p>Coming out into the sunlight again, I noted that
Tarn had done a little levelling and road-making to
enable him to get his car into Felonsdene from the
lower side of the hollow. This would give him a
greater distance to go if he were driving to Helmstone,
but by the shorter route which I had taken
the approach was quite impracticable for a car.</p>

<p>And then, quite by chance, I noticed among the
stunted trees of the orchard something white that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
at a little distance looked not unlike a big milestone.
As I entered the orchard the dog whined and lay
down. I supposed that he was tired and left him
there. A nearer view showed me a column about
three feet square and about four feet in height, neatly
built up of rough lumps of chalk. On the top of
the column were a pile of ashes and charred wood.
It was then that its resemblance to a sacrificial altar,
such as I had seen pictured in an old illustrated
Bible, first struck me. Among the ashes something
gleamed and sparkled. I fished it out with a bit of
stick. It was a small circlet of soft gold, evidently
not European work, and might have served as a
child's bangle. And my disturbance of the ashes
had shown me other things.</p>

<p>I found an old wine-case in one of the sheds, and
in this I placed all that I had found on the top of
the altar. The lower part of the ashes and the top
of the altar were still quite warm from the fire. I
carried the case up to my car, sweating with the effort
and my hurry. I put the case in the tonneau and
covered it with a rug, and then, with the dog by my
side, I went home as fast as I could drive.</p>

<p>My partner had returned from his round and
joined me in my examination of what was in the case.
Incineration had been imperfect and we had no doubt
whatever. I could state confidently that on an
altar in an orchard at Felonsdene the body of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
young child had been burned, within thirty-six hours
of the time of my discovery, which was precisely
twenty minutes past twelve on the morning of 29th
March. I returned at once to my car and drove to
the police-station, where I gave my information.</p>

<p>The number and the appearance of Tarn's car were
well known. A white man travelling with a negress
cannot go anywhere in England without being
noticed. He and the woman had been in Paris
before, and the man had admitted to Perrot, under
circumstances which might have overcome his usual
reticence, that he was going to France. The inspector
who saw me felt sure that Tarn would be
found, and the whole mystery cleared up, in a very
short time.</p>

<p>Tarn and Mala were never found. They had been
seen in the car in the very early morning of the 28th.
The car itself was found at Melcombe Cliffs, an unimportant
place on the coast about five miles from
Helmstone. Inquiries at ports gave negative results;
no negress accompanied by a white man had
gone by any of the boats; the only negress who had
gone abroad bore no resemblance to Mala and was
satisfactorily accounted for.</p>

<p>The coroner was extremely polite to me at the
inquest on the remains of the child. He said that
I had given my evidence in a most clear and open
manner. I had mentioned circumstances which I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
thought to be suspicious, and of course it was my
duty to mention them. But still I had admitted
fully&mdash;and he thought it a most important point&mdash;that
both Tarn and his wife were devoted to the
child. It made any theory that they had been
guilty of the horrible crime of murdering the child
seem very improbable. Tarn had married a negress
and was very sensitive on the point; he lived alone;
he hated any publicity. It seemed to him more
likely that the child died suddenly, perhaps as the
result of an accident, when Tarn and his wife were
on the point of departure; and that sooner than face
the publicity and inquiry, they had taken this quite
illegal way of disposing of the body. Tarn was an
educated man and he would know that what he had
done was illegal. He would be anxious to avoid
detection, and would probably change his plans in
consequence. He was also a wealthy man; the
abandonment of the motor-car would not mean very
much to him. Inquiries had been made on the
supposition that Tarn and his wife had gone to
France; but they might have gone elsewhere. They
might have shipped from Liverpool. A negress
with the help of a thick motor-veil, a wig, and grease-paints
might easily conceal her race for a little while.
The absence of any evidence from people at Melcombe
Cliffs and the neighbourhood seemed rather
to point to this. Tarn was a gloomy man of rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
morbid and religious temperament. He had certainly
said some extraordinary things, but the bark
of a man of that type was generally worse than his
bite. The cremation of the child's body was wrong
and illegal, but the jury had nothing to do with that.
There was really no evidence pointing to murder;
on the contrary, they had heard that both parents
were devoted to their child. An inconclusive verdict
was given.</p>

<p>It was on 27th March that the child was born; a
year later precisely its body was burned. It may
have been a coincidence; it may not. I, at any
rate, have never been able to accept the coroner's
comforting theory. I remember that negress too
well, and the power that she and her horrible faith
had over her husband. They loved their child, I
believe. But in the propitiation of the Power of
evil, the dearer the victim the more potent will be
the sacrifice. They must have been insane in the
end. And possibly the sea at Melcombe Cliffs still
holds the secret of what became of them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE FEAST AND THE RECKONING</h2>


<p>Mr Duncan Garth stood at his windows
in park Lane and looked out. He was a man
of forty-five, unusually tall and broad, with a strong,
clean-shaven face.</p>

<p>"I should rather like," he said, "to buy Hyde
Park."</p>

<p>His secretary, seated at a table behind him,
chuckled.</p>

<p>"You are quite right, Ferguson," said Garth.
"I can't buy Hyde Park or the National Gallery.
But I presume I've got the money value of both.
Wouldn't you say so, Ferguson?"</p>

<p>Ferguson was a slender young man. He looked
far too young for the important post of secretary
to Mr Garth, and much younger than he really was.
His scrupulous care as to his personal appearance
rather amused Garth, who was careless in such
matters almost to the point of untidiness.</p>

<p>Ferguson lit a cigarette and reflected. "I should
say not," he said. "Hyde Park alone, of course,
you could buy, if it were for sale. I don't know
what the National Gallery would figure out at, but
silly people give absurd sums for paint and canvas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
nowadays, and there's any amount of it there. You
might be able to do them both, but I should doubt it."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going to give a luncheon-party, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ferguson, drily, "you can afford to
do that. Whom am I to ask?"</p>

<p>Garth consulted some memoranda on the back
of an envelope. "I'm going to mix 'em up a bit,"
he said. "You remember that girl in the post-office
yesterday?"</p>

<p>"The one who asked if you'd got any eyes in your
head?"</p>

<p>"Yes. One should not, of course, hand in telegrams
to the money-order department. There was
something in the bitter fury of the woman that interested
me. Naturally, I don't know her name and
address, but I suppose you can get that."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Ferguson, making a shorthand
note.</p>

<p>"Then I must have old Lady Longshore. I should
like an actor-manager, too. Could you suggest?"</p>

<p>"Want him for his egotism?"</p>

<p>"Quite so," said Mr Garth. "Of course."</p>

<p>"Then you can't do better than Eustace Richards.
A fluent talker. But you've met him."</p>

<p>"So I have," said Garth, "now I come to think
of it. He will do admirably. Then I should like
Archdeacon Pringle and his wife, and that chap I
went to about my throat."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me see," said Ferguson&mdash;"that was Sir
Edwin Goodchild, wasn't it? A good sort&mdash;I know
him well. Any more?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Lots more. I want that man who sweeps
the crossing just outside the club. He always seemed
to me to be full of character. His name is Timbs,
and I don't know his address. But in this case perhaps
you'd better not write. See him personally.
Could you get me a nice Suffragette?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Ferguson. "Any particular
one?"</p>

<p>"No. Just an ordinary, plain Suffragette. Also
the editor of <i>Happy Homes</i>. Likewise the Unconquerable
Belgian. I don't know at which of the halls
he's wrestling now, but you can find out."</p>

<p>"Suppose his trainer won't let him come?"</p>

<p>"My dear Ferguson, you know very well how to
deal with a case like that. There are solid inducements
that influence opinion."</p>

<p>"True. Would you like the girl who does my
nails?"</p>

<p>"Your manicurist? Yes, that's an excellent
idea. We shall also need a Cabinet Minister, a nice
specimen of a modern gilded youth, and somebody
prominent in the Salvation Army."</p>

<p>The list was finally made out. Ferguson looked
at it reflectively. "I suppose you wouldn't ask
me too," he said. "I wish to goodness you would!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can come if you've got any decent clothes,"
said Garth, sardonically. "Behave yourself decently,
mind. Don't giggle."</p>

<p>"Right," said Ferguson. "This will be the day of
my life. You know all your servants will give
notice, of course. But that doesn't matter, you can
get others."</p>

<p>"It might simplify things," said Mr Garth, "if
I took some rooms at the Ritz and gave the luncheon
there. Arrange that for me, will you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. And the date?"</p>

<p>"You'll want a little time to get the gang together.
Say four weeks from to-day."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mr Ferguson needed all his tact to get them together.
Lady Longshore, it is true, expressed herself
as willing to meet anybody except her own
relations. But Eustace Richards, on being told
of the idea of the party, said quite frankly that he
preferred to mix with his equals. "The devil of it
is to find 'em," said Ferguson. Richards, still
frank, admitted that in the present state of dramatic
art there might be something in that. He decided
to attend. A Suffragette was caught by the bait of
the Cabinet Minister, who subsequently refused on
hearing of the Suffragette. Sir Edwin Goodchild,
the editor of <i>Happy Homes</i>, the manicure lady, and
Colonel Harriet Stokes, of the Salvation Army, ac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>cepted
at once. Mr Timbs, who swept the crossing
outside the club, was suspicious and took longer to
decide. "Look 'ere, Mr Ferguson," he said, "is
it strite? You aren't gettin' anythin' up for me,
eh? I've got a good suit o' clothes, so far as that
goes; one I've kept for funerals, so far. But I don't
want to put that on for nothing. Barrin' sells, now,
is it strite?" With renewed assurances Ferguson
secured him. The lady of the post-office began with
a direct refusal, which started in the third person
and trailed off into the first. It said that she had
not the honour of Mr Garth's acquaintance, and that
she was at a loss to understand, and so on. Ferguson
returned to the attack, and, metaphorically, dangled
the Dowager Countess of Longshore before her.
This failing, he changed his fly, and caught her with
the Archdeacon. The Archdeacon had known her
father, and seemed to Miss Bostock to guarantee
everything. It was not absolutely fair, as the Archdeacon
had a professional engagement in the North
on that day, and had been compelled to refuse. Mrs
Pringle, however, would be present, and, as Ferguson
said in self-justification, Mrs Pringle was more
archidiaconal than any archdeacon living. The
Unconquerable Belgian accepted in a letter written
by Mr Savage, his trainer. Mr Savage expressed
a hope that the Unconquerable would not be
pressed to drink, and that he would be able to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
get away for a professional engagement at four
o'clock.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>On the day appointed, Lady Longshore was the
first guest to be announced.</p>

<p>"Came early on purpose," she said. "This is to
be a freak lunch, so Fergy says, and I want to get
the hang of it."</p>

<p>"It's simplicity itself," said Garth. "You are
going to meet people whom you have never met
before. Conventions that would interfere with this
are abandoned. You will not, for instance, sit next
to me."</p>

<p>"Nor to me," added Mr Ferguson. "But bear up."</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Fergy, and tell me all about it."</p>

<p>Ferguson glanced at a plan of the table. "On
your right hand, Lady Longshore, you will have
Mr Timbs, who sweeps one of the principal crossings
in St James's Street, on your left will be Mr Pudbrook,
who edits that serviceable kitchen weekly,
<i>Happy Homes</i>. But the table is oval, and we hope
that the conversation will be general."</p>

<p>"Well, it's not half a bad idea. Let me look at
the rest of 'em." She snatched the plan from the
secretary's hand. "Thank Heaven, I haven't got
Eustace Richards&mdash;these mummers make me angry.
Here, who's this?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Renard had just been announced.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>"That," said Ferguson, in a low voice, "is Monsieur
Renard, better known as the Unconquerable Belgian.
You may have seen him on the stage."</p>

<p>"Quite a good deal of him&mdash;<i>m&ecirc;me trop</i>," said the
Countess.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Belgian extended a hand like
a twenty-pound York ham. He was an enormous
athlete, whose sweet temper had not yet been injured
by his prolonged war with fat. He was of great
simplicity, and his forehead ran back at a gentle
slope from his eyebrows to the back of his head.
Intelligent? <i>Mais que voulez-vous que je vous dise?</i>
Can one have everything? His clothes were of the
best quality and of the latest fashion. Let us be
content.</p>

<p>Duncan Garth grasped some of the extended hand.
"This is most kind of you, Monsieur Renard. We
have all admired your prowess, and are delighted to
have the chance to know you a little better."</p>

<p>The Belgian was slow and self-possessed. "Thank&mdash;you,"
he said.</p>

<p>"We shall have to behave ourselves," laughed
Garth, "or you'll be throwing all of us out of the
window."</p>

<p>"But no," said the Unconquerable, seriously.
"That will not be so. My manager does not permit
me to do anything of that kind, unless arranged with
him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"It would be an excellent advertisement," said
Garth. "Just you think it over." He turned to
some new arrivals.</p>

<p>At this moment Ferguson laid a manicured hand
on the Belgian's almighty arm. "Pardon me,
Monsieur Renard, but the Countess of Longshore is
most anxious that you should be presented to her."</p>

<p>"That is all right. I kom," said the placid
wrestler.</p>

<p>The new arrivals were Miss Bostock of the post-office,
Sir Edwin Goodchild of Harley Street, and
Mr Pudbrook of <i>Happy Homes</i>. Miss Bostock was
tailor-made, smooth-haired, rather hygienic about
the boots, and wore pince-nez. She looked as if
she would have been handsomer if she had been
happier. Her voice shook a little as she responded
to Mr Garth's most respectful salutation, but her
nervousness was not too apparent.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is the Archdeacon here, Mr Garth?" she
inquired. "He used to know my father slightly."</p>

<p>"The Archdeacon regrets&mdash;a conference at York.
But that is Mrs Pringle just coming in. Let me take
you up to her."</p>

<p>Sir Edwin Goodchild took Mr Garth's secretary
aside. "I say, Fergy," he said, "what the deuce
is all this?"</p>

<p>"This?" said Ferguson, innocently. "This is a
private reception-room at the Ritz. Style, Louis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Quinze or thereabouts. Through those folding
doors, when at the appointed time they are opened,
we enter the luncheon-room. There we eat huitres<i>
Lucullus, consomm&eacute; norv&eacute;gienne, filets</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, don't talk nonsense."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, man? Considering I constructed the
menu myself, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, but the people. Look at that lot just
come in."</p>

<p>"My poor lost sheep, I'll tell you just two things.
Firstly, we are eccentric millionaires. Secondly,
you will be seated at lunch between Colonel Harriet
Stokes, of the Salvation Army, and Miss Paul, a
manicure lady."</p>

<p>"Let me out. This is a nightmare."</p>

<p>"No, it's a fact, and I'll prove it to you by introducing
to your kind attention Mr Pudbrook, the
editor of <i>Happy Homes</i>. He somewhat interferes
with your profession by giving remedies for black-heads
and indigestion in his paper on alternate weeks.
But don't let that prejudice you against him."</p>

<p>Certainly, the "lot" to which Sir Edwin referred
looked strange enough in their present <i>entourage</i>.
Mr Timbs wore a complete suit of black broadcloth,
alleviated by new brown shoes, white socks, and a
very large crimson silk handkerchief. His expression
combined curiously the confident and the furtive.
Those in his immediate neighbourhood were con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>scious
of a blended fragrance of benzine and yellow
soap. A white-faced woman with big eyes, severely
uniformed, was in conversation with him, and Mr
Timbs was choosing his language with unusual care.
Miss Edith Stunt, the Suffragette, had faced meetings
in Trafalgar Square, and had nothing more to
fear. Her fanatical eyes looked round eagerly for
an opportunity to say a good word. At present
Duncan Garth was talking to Mrs Gust, a nicely-dressed
lady, slightly mad. The death of her husband
under treatment had not shaken her faith in
Christian Science, any more than his life had shaken
her belief in matrimony. Garth himself had discovered
her, and had directed that she should be of the party.</p>

<p>Miss Vera Paul, the manicurist, was talking to
Ferguson. She was a remarkably pretty girl, but
there were many others who wished to speak to
Ferguson. He handed her over to Mrs Pringle,
and promised her that she should be next to him at
luncheon. The Unconquerable Belgian bore down
on Ferguson, carrying in his hand a copy of the menu,
with which Ferguson had thoughtfully provided
him. He tapped it with a heavy finger and said
plaintively: "You excuse me. I cannot eat moch
this food." Ferguson's suggestion of a porter-house
steak was accepted. At the same moment Timbs
approached him with care, as of one who stalked big
game.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"You'll keep your eye on me, sir," said Timbs.
"You told me it was strite, and it's to you I looks.
I don't want to do anything I didn't ought."</p>

<p>"My dear chap," said Ferguson, with candour,
"we want you to do the things you didn't ought."</p>

<p>Timbs would have pursued the conversation, but
he was put aside by Miss Edith Stunt, who wished
to know if she would have an opportunity to say a
few words to the company. And she was put aside
by Harriet Stokes, who wished to know if she could
send round a collecting-card. And Harriet Stokes
was obliterated by Mr Pudbrook, who wished to
know if he could get a few words on private business
with Mr Garth.</p>

<p>Then came the arrival of the last guest. Mr
Eustace Richards made a splendid entrance; he
was a quarter of an hour late and gracefully apologetic.
"An unexpected rehearsal, my dear fellow,"
he said to Garth in a clearly-articulated whisper that
carried to every part of the room, "Royal command
for next Friday. Quite unexpected. Gratifying,
eh?"</p>

<p>The big folding-doors opened. Ferguson flew
around with his plan of the table, showing people
where they were to sit. So far Mr Eustace Richards
had hardly glanced at the company. He did not
look much at the audience when he was acting, and
he was almost always acting. But now he mur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>mured
to Garth: "My dear fellow, you warned
me&mdash;but what have you done?"</p>

<p>"Don't quite know yet," said Garth, drily.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mr Ferguson had his own little suite of rooms at
the house in Park Lane. He dined at his club that
night, and was back again by nine o'clock to check
once more some figures of considerable importance.
The work only took him a few minutes, and he was
just finishing it when Duncan Garth entered, wearing
the dinner-jacket and black tie of the domestic life.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" said Ferguson. "Thought you were
dining at the Silchesters'."</p>

<p>"So I was," said Garth, dejectedly, "but I didn't."
He selected a cigar from his secretary's cabinet.</p>

<p>"Cheaper for you, anyhow," said Ferguson.
"His Grace meant to borrow money to-night."</p>

<p>"I'm not a fool," said Garth, wearily, "and I'm
not lending money to the Duke of Silchester. How
did you think it went this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"What? The lunch? Of course it was very,
very funny."</p>

<p>"Or slightly tragic," said Garth, as he took an
easy-chair. "Put people into new circumstances
and you can always judge them. I've got a low
opinion of the human race to-night, Fergy."</p>

<p>"But there were nice points," said Ferguson.
"I like the self-centred, complete indifference of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
friend Renard. He's a headless Hercules. I mean,
his head is the only thing against him. It's a loss,
too, that is easily excused. You saw how Lady
Longshore, and Mrs Pringle, and Colonel Harriet
Stokes of the Salvation Army were anxious to please
that lump of beef."</p>

<p>"Of course I saw it. That's one of the reasons
why I call the thing a tragedy. By the way, you
can go over our list and draw a line through the
Archdeacon and his wife."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Ferguson. "Might one ask
why?"</p>

<p>"Because I hate the type," said Garth. "Miss
Bostock's father was a curate, had been at college
with the Archdeacon, and knew him fairly well.
Mrs Pringle snubbed Miss Bostock. She was afraid
she could not remember all the curates that her husband
might have happened to meet. She also
snubbed Pudbrook. When she saw the nature of
the party she would have left but for Lady Longshore,
who, to do her credit, does not care one curse
about anybody on this earth or elsewhere. She
was almost affectionate to Timbs when Lady Longshore
repeated his stories. She was quite nice to
your manicurist girl. She recognised the charm
of the Unconquerable Belgian. But she snubbed
Miss Bostock and she snubbed Pudbrook. She
admits the hopeless and snubs the hopeful. She is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
a mixture of the coward and the bully. I don't
like it, and I've no more to do with it. Strike
them off, Fergy. I shall feel happier when it's
done."</p>

<p>Ferguson took down an alphabetical list, turned
up the letter "P," and put a black ink cross where
it was required. "I wonder what this has cost you,"
he said cheerfully.</p>

<p>"You paid the bill. Nothing, anyhow."</p>

<p>"The Salvationist got a subscription, and so did
Mrs Gust. The Suffragette also hit you. I think
you have promised to be manicured. Mr Pudbrook
owns half his paper, and the printer owns the other
half. They are not doing too well, and they are
thinking of a limited company. You know best
how far you have come into it. Eustace Richards,
in spite of his jabber, has done no good with his last
two things. He stayed with you for some time. If
he was not suggesting that you should release him
from the people who are financing him at present,
then, of course, it's my mistake."</p>

<p>"You're a clear-sighted chap," said Garth, "and
you've mentioned nothing which is very far out.
There are even some things which you might have
mentioned and have omitted. They don't really
matter. I've done what was wanted. I've even
shown Lady Longshore how to make the money she
wants. But that's not what's worrying me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Give it a name," said Ferguson.</p>

<p>The door opened. "A young person of the name
of Bostock wishes to see you, sir," said the butler.
"I have told her that you are not in the habit of
seeing people at this time of the evening, but she
seemed rather pressing."</p>

<p>"In here, please," said Garth.</p>

<p>"Let's see," said Ferguson, "Miss Bostock left
before the show was over."</p>

<p>"She did," said Garth; "and I want to know
why."</p>

<p>In the meantime the butler had returned to Miss
Bostock with a totally different manner. So far
as the rules went, he had made no mistake, but there
were exceptions, of course. On sight, Miss Bostock
was a young person. On further investigation she
was a young lady whom Mr Duncan Garth wished
to see, and that made a difference.</p>

<p>She entered the room with perfect composure,
wearing the same clothes that she had worn at the
luncheon-party.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shouldn't have come," she said, "but
there are things I want to say. I want to know why
you did that."</p>

<p>"You'll sit down, won't you?" said Garth.
"What is it precisely we are talking about?"</p>

<p>"Why did you give that luncheon? Why did
you make me come to it? I refused at first, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
know. Then Mr Ferguson came to see me and persuaded
me. He told me the Archdeacon was coming,
and that seemed like a mutual acquaintance. I think
if he had been there he wouldn't have been as rude to
me as his wife was. I dare say, if I had told her I
was a general servant, she would have been as sweet to
me as she was to that half-drunken crossing-sweeper,
or that Belgian brute, or some of the other people
whom you ought not to have asked me to
meet."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr Ferguson, cheerfully. "Lady
Longshore also is very unconventional, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"I'm not speaking about that," said Miss Bostock,
doggedly. "The rudeness of that lady to me is a
small personal matter easily forgotten. It's the
ghastly humiliation of the whole thing that makes
me sick and savage."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. "Ferguson,"
said Garth, "there was that letter."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ferguson, "I'll see to it," and passed
out of the room.</p>

<p>"Now, then," said Garth. "What's the trouble,
Miss Bostock?"</p>

<p>"The trouble is that the whole of us were merely
a show got up for your amusement. You gave us
a lunch that we might make fools of ourselves. Fish
out of water are very absurd, aren't they? But it's
cruel to take them out of water and to watch them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
dying, all the same. That luncheon-party was the
most brutal thing done in London to-day, and you
were the brute who did it. What harm was I doing?
Why did you drag me into it?"</p>

<p>"Five or six weeks ago," said Garth, "I met you
for the first time. It was in the post-office. You
asked me if I'd got any eyes in my head."</p>

<p>"I remember now," said Miss Bostock. "I
ought not to have said it. I think the tick of the
telegraph gets on my nerves. You were not the first,
too, and the notices were up clear enough. Still,
why couldn't you have reported me? That would
have been the right way to punish me."</p>

<p>"No," said Garth, "I did not want to punish you.
I distinctly liked the spirit and the temper with
which you spoke to me. You will understand, perhaps,
that I get rather too much of the other kind of
thing. I had no wish whatever to humiliate you.
I did wish to amuse myself. You may be glad to
hear that I have not done it. Is there anything I
can do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing now," said the girl, contemptuously.</p>

<p>"I think there is," said Garth, and rang the bell.
He sent the servant to fetch Mr Ferguson.</p>

<p>"I say, Ferguson," said Garth, "can you tell me
what the price of that luncheon was?"</p>

<p>"Eight shillings a head, exclusive of the wine,
of course."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me see, Miss Bostock," said Garth, "I think
you drank water."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I see it now," said Miss Bostock, eagerly.
She fumbled clumsily at her pocket, and produced
an emaciated purse. She took out half a sovereign.
"There is your money. Can you give me change?"</p>

<p>Garth did not carry money. Ferguson handed
Garth a florin, and Garth gravely handed it to Miss
Bostock.</p>

<p>"Now I can breathe again," she said. "I am
going now. Good-night."</p>

<p>Garth followed her out, along the corridor and into
the hall. Servants were waiting at the door. A sign
from Garth dismissed them. As he held the door
open for her, she turned to him, hesitated, and then
spoke.</p>

<p>"I thought at lunch to-day that the doctor was
the only gentleman there. I&mdash;I am not so sure about
it."</p>

<p>"If I were ten years younger," said Garth, "I
think I should ask you to marry me. Good-night."</p>

<p>He stood watching her as she passed down the
steps into Park Lane.</p>

<h2>POST-MORTEM</h2>



<h4>I</h4>


<p>After dining for the last time at his club, Evan
Hurst returned at once to his flat in Jermyn
Street. The greater part of his arrangements had
already been made, and most of his things packed;
but there were still a few details to settle, and he was
to leave for the north early on the following morning.</p>

<p>Yet when he entered his room he did not proceed
at once to letter-writing or to business of any kind.
He flung himself down in an easy-chair. He felt
unaccountably tired. All day he had had business
to attend to, necessary no doubt for the carrying
out of his somewhat wild and romantic scheme, none
the less wearisome to a man of poetical temperament
and of poor physique. He was a man of slight
build, with fair and rather fluffy hair, a pretty,
thin-lipped mouth, and plaintive blue eyes. To
the world in general his lot would have seemed
a fairly easy one. He had sufficient means of his
own; and no one in any way depended upon him.
His volume of poems, <i>Under the Sea</i>, published a
year or two before, had excited a great deal of public
attention and some controversy; what had seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
genius to one critic had seemed insanity to another.
He was not unpopular at his club although he was
thought to be slightly ridiculous. It was not supposed
that he had any trouble of any kind. Women,
of whom in his poems he wrote with such knowledge
and such fervency, had never really come much into
his life.</p>

<p>As he lay there and smoked endless cigarettes, he
admitted the truth to himself. It was vanity that
was at the root of it. He had seen the talented and
remarkable Evan Hurst dwindling down into nobody
again. Once it was supposed that Evan
Hurst was dead, dead by his own act, and leaving
such strange communications behind him, interest
would revive. People would speak again of <i>Under
the Sea</i>, his unpublished poems would be produced,
and there would be obituary notices. There would
be, for a while at least, breathless interest in the
poet and the suicide, and he, alive and not dead,
under another name and acting another part, would
read and enjoy it all. To carry out his scheme
meant many sacrifices, but the fascination of it was
too strong for him, and the success of it seemed to
be certain.</p>

<p>His sensations were really very much those of a
man who actually knows that he is about to die.
He had withdrawn a large balance from his bank and
transferred it to another bank in the name which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
now intended to take, but it was essential if Evan
Hurst were to die that he should leave money behind
him. That money he willingly sacrificed. It was
enough if he retained for his new incarnation sufficient
for a reasonable livelihood. It annoyed him
far more to think that he must leave also his books,
the collections, the furniture and the treasures of his
Jermyn Street flat. They had all come together
slowly, and all represented in a way his individuality.
The scattering of them by public auction would be
like the disintegration of death. He could imagine
already the notice in the catalogue of a second-hand
bookseller offering that exquisitely-bound set of
Huysman's works, "containing the book-plate of
the late Evan Hurst." There were prints and engravings
that from long affection and study had
given him almost a feeling as if he had had a part in
their creation. The Durer, a splendid impression,
would fetch fifty pounds at least. Men at the club
would remember this evening. They would recall
that Evan Hurst was there only a few days before
his death, and that even then they had remarked
how gloomy and silent he seemed to be.</p>

<p>He laughed bitterly and aloud, flung down his
cigarette and passed into his bedroom. There for
a while he packed energetically, but soon he had to
stop for a feeling of intense and almost painful
weariness came over him again. After all there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
would be time to finish the packing in the morning.
He decided to go to bed.</p>

<p>On the following afternoon he left King's Cross
for Salsay on the Yorkshire coast.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Salsay is a small fishing village that has not yet
suffered from the curse of popularity. Evan Hurst
put up at the one hotel in the place and constituted
its one permanent visitor. Occasionally a commercial
traveller would arrive one day and leave on
the next, and would talk as much as possible to Evan
Hurst. Evan Hurst, in return, would talk as little
as possible, consistent with bare politeness, to the
commercial traveller. Every morning he bathed
from the shore before breakfast at a point at some
considerable distance from the village. Here there
was a small cave in the cliffs, a useful shelter if rain
came on, and useful to Evan Hurst for other purposes;
for it was here that gradually, bit by bit, he
collected the slender outfit with which he was to
begin the world in his new character on the day that
Evan Hurst was supposed to commit suicide. His
plan was simplicity itself. He would go out to
bathe as usual, and he would not return. His
clothes would be found on the shore, and in the
pocket of his coat there would be a letter to the land<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>lord
of the hotel leaving no doubt whatever as to his
intentions. In the meantime, in a little cave, he would
have altered his appearance, put on different clothes,
and from there struck out for the nearest railway
station. In the evening he would be in Dover, and
next day in Paris, without one tie left between what
he had once been and what he was now going to be.</p>

<p>He looked forward to the change with pleasurable
excitement. It was something more than vanity
after all. As Evan Hurst he had begun in a <i>r&ocirc;le</i>
which he was not competent to sustain; to have
continued in it would have been to disappoint the
public opinion of him. In a new part he could
write as he liked; act as he liked; talk as he liked.
There would be no preconceived opinion of him in
the world; it would be all for him to make with the
benefit of his experience of his past blunders.</p>

<p>He took immense care with the composition of
that brief letter to the landlord. It ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;It would be impossible to explain
to you the reasons why I intend this morning to take
my life, but undoubtedly some apology is due to you
for any inconvenience which my death may cause
you. I leave behind me at the hotel a quantity of
money which will be more than sufficient to discharge
my obligations to you. Nor have I any explanation
to offer to the coroner and the British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
jury. These good people will return their usual
verdict. Not to be interested in so extremely uninteresting
a thing as my life has become, would be
a clear proof to them of insanity. I shall swim out
so long as my strength lasts, and the end will come
under the sea.&mdash;Faithfully yours,</p>

<p style='text-align:right'>
"<span class="smcap">Evan Hurst.</span>"<br />
</p></div>

<p>He did not quite like it now that he had finished
it. The way in which he had introduced the title
of his book seemed to him to be a little on the cheap
side, but at any rate it was a letter which would call
for a good deal of comment. He promised himself
much amusing and interesting reading when the
English papers reached Paris a few days later.</p>

<p>The morning came at last; grey, overcast, and
misty, and more likely to turn to great heat than to
rain. Evan Hurst looked at himself in the glass
and laughed. He had spent some hours in his room
the night before dyeing his fluffy hair. Unquestionably
it was an improvement to his appearance.
There was no danger that it would be observed on
his leaving the hotel; for he wore his towels slung
round his neck, and a broad-brimmed straw hat.
As he walked towards the cave he now felt an unaccountable
nervousness. True, but few people
went that way, and even if they entered the cave
his store of clothes was so carefully hidden that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
was unlikely that anybody would find them. Still,
there was just a chance, and it would be maddening
if just at the last some trifle occurred to balk his
scheme. He breathed a sigh of relief when he found
everything just as he had left it. In less than half
an hour the change was complete; the clothes of
that fluffy poet, Evan Hurst, were disposed with a
careful carelessness on the rocks above high-water
mark, with the letter to the landlord in the pocket
of the coat, and Evan Hurst, in his new incarnation,
strode away in a blue serge suit, black felt hat, and
black boots, carrying a small bag, which contained
a change of linen and the articles of his toilet. The
rest of his luggage was to be purchased in London.</p>

<p>For the first mile or so his way lay along the beach,
and he was careful to walk on the sand, where, in
half an hour, the sea would obliterate his footprints.
His feelings were at first those of amusement. In
every little detail of his clothes he was so different
from what he had ever been before. He speculated
whether he would not perforce become quite a different
kind of man under the clothes' influence. Already
he felt himself a stouter person, readier to
tackle the world and deal with it properly. His
satisfaction was intense. He was still meditating
on the subject when he reached the path up the
cliffs; a perfectly easy and safe path with a few low
rocks between him and it. As he clambered over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the rocks, inconvenienced by the bag that he was
carrying, he slipped and fell, and lay quite still.</p>

<p>The hours passed, and now the sun blazed. The
waves had already touched one of the black boots.
They crept up to the head and came back with a
pinky stain. At last, when the figure was fully
covered, it gave a sudden and ungainly movement,
and for a little while floated with arms and legs shot
out queerly like the limbs of a starfish. The black
felt hat had drifted far away, and tossed about on
the waves with absurdity. Then, slowly, the figure
disappeared from sight.</p>

<h2>THE GIRL WITH THE BEAUTIFUL HAIR</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[By my own unaided intelligence I chose the exactly right
spot at the farther end of the orchard, and with my own hand
I slung the hammock. Now that the day is hot and luncheon
is over, I take my book and go thither to reap the fruits of my
labour. And, behold, the hammock is already occupied with
four large cushions and one small girl&mdash;a solemn and inscrutable
girl who hears to the end a complaint of the cruelty and
injustice of her trespass, and then says kindly that I may sit on
the grass.</p>

<p>"Thank you. I am glad you do not want all the grass as
well."</p>

<p>I do the best that I can with the grass, and open my book,
and the voice from the hammock bids me to tell a story.</p>

<p>"What, with no better audience than that?"</p>

<p>It appears that this is the charm. She has never had a story
all to herself before.]</p></div>


<p>There once was a girl who had very long and
very beautiful hair.</p>

<p>(<i>As long as yours? Much longer and much more
beautiful. And if you interrupt me again, I will stop
this story, empty you out of the hammock, tie you to a
tree, and teach you as much as I can remember of the
French gender rules. Very well, then.</i>)</p>

<p>As I was saying&mdash;there once was a girl who had very
long and very beautiful hair, and she knew it. Her
sisters, who were as plain-spoken as sisters generally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
are, were in the habit of saying that she was a perfect
peacock. Her hair was very much the colour of a
chestnut, and she took the greatest possible care of
it. It was a rule of life with her, when she had
nothing else to do, to brush her hair. Frequently
also she brushed it when she had other things to do.
She never would have it cut. She even refused a
lock of it to her own mother. When she went out
for walks with her sisters she listened attentively
as people passed her, because sometimes they said
things about her hair which she liked very much.
Then she would try not to look pleased, and when
a girl who is really pleased tries to look as if she did
not care, she looks perfectly horrid. Her sisters
remarked upon it.</p>

<p>Her father, who was a good and wise man, explained
to her how wicked vanity was, especially
vanity about one's hair. He showed her that personal
attractions, especially if connected in any way
with the hair, were worthless as compared with the
intellectual and moral attributes. On the other
hand, her mother took her to a photographer's and
had her taken in fourteen different positions, and they
all made such beautiful pictures that the photographer
nearly committed suicide because he was
not allowed to exhibit them in his shop window.</p>

<p>She reached the age at which every good Christian
girl wishes to have long dresses and do her hair up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
into a lump, but this girl (whose name was Elsa, of
course) would not have her hair done up, and stamped
with her foot and was rude to the governess. In the
end, of course, Elsa had to submit, for it is very
wicked for girls of a certain age to wear their hair
down. But she became extremely ingenious. She
had ways of doing that hair so that it would not stop
up, but tumbled down unexpectedly and caused
great admiration. She would then pretend to be
confused and embarrassed. Now, when a girl who
is not in the least confused and embarrassed tries
to look so, she looks simply silly. Her sisters told
her so. Every single girl friend she had, and many
who were only acquaintances, had seen that hair in
its native glory. Some of these raved about it to
Elsa's sisters, and were surprised that the sisters did
not share their enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"She has such a lot of it," the friends would say.</p>

<p>"She thinks such a lot of it," the sisters would
answer.</p>

<p>Now, Elsa and her sisters were not the only girls
in the world, and they did not know all the rest;
consequently a girl called Kate came to them as
something of a novelty. As she was called Kate,
she was, of course, quite good. Katherine may be
proud, and Kitty may be frivolous, but Kate is
solid. If you ask me if Kate is clever, I reply that
she is a good housekeeper. If you ask me if she is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
pretty, I change the subject rapidly. There was nothing
dazzling about this Kate. She was just Kate.</p>

<p>It is a sad truth that it is the people who are naturally
the nicest to look at who take the greatest
trouble to look nice. The woman who, so far as her
face is concerned, makes the best of a bad job, is
very rare. Kate was not a beauty, but she was sensible
and resigned. She dressed herself very quickly
in things that wore well. It was her boast that she
could do her hair without a looking-glass, and everybody
who saw her hair believed it. But as it happened,
when Kate met Elsa, a change came over her.</p>

<p>"Your hair is perfectly divine," she said to Elsa.</p>

<p>Elsa tried to be politely bored.</p>

<p>"So kind of you to say so," she said. "I get
frightfully sick of my old wig myself. It's an endless
bother."</p>

<p>"And you do it so beautifully," said Kate. "I
do wish you'd give me some idea for my hair, so that
it wouldn't look awful."</p>

<p>"It isn't awful at all," said Elsa, politely. "I don't
think I should change the way of doing it if I were you."</p>

<p>Then she went into elaborate technical details
and showed Kate that the thing was bad and that
improvement was impossible. Of course, she did
not use these words, and was sweetly delicate about it.</p>

<p>Now, that night, as Elsa was having her own hair
brushed, a horrible suspicion came over her. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
put it aside as a thing perfectly absurd. It might
have been a trick of the looking-glass. It might
have been her own imagination. It did not keep
her awake for a moment. But next morning one of
her sisters came into her room, looked at her, and said:
"What an idiot you were to have your hair cut!"</p>

<p>"I have not had it cut," said Elsa, furiously.
"It's the same as it always was."</p>

<p>"Rubbish," said the sister. "It's three inches
shorter at least."</p>

<p>"It's not," said Elsa; "and I wish you'd go
away. I can't get on properly while you're hanging
about talking."</p>

<p>The sister went away, and Elsa flew to the looking-glass.
The cold morning light confirmed her suspicions
of the night before. Her sister&nbsp;was perfectly right.
Elsa's hair was undoubtedly three inches shorter.</p>

<p>That afternoon Elsa secretly and surreptitiously
went to a great hair specialist. She had seen his
advertisement, and she felt that here she might at
any rate know the worst. He looked at her hair and
said that it had become shorter from a shrinkage in
the cells, owing to undue epithelial activity of the
cranium. It was as well that she came to him when
she did. As it was, if she would rub in a little of his
relaxative she would have nothing to fear. He then
sold her a fourpenny pot of pomatum for three
guineas, washed his hands, and went home to tea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>But the pomatum was quite ineffectual. Every
day her hair seemed to be a little shorter and a little
thinner. This was particularly the case when she
had been behaving like a peacock or like a spiteful
cat. It reached a point when all her friends who met
her exclaimed: "Why, Elsa, what on earth have
you done with your hair?"</p>

<p>Then she would smile sweetly and say: "Brushed
it. What did you think?" But inwardly she was
a mad woman.</p>

<p>About this time she saw the advertisement of the
Indian hair doctor, and she thought she could but
try. I do not think the man was really Indian, I
know he was not really a doctor, and I fancy he did
not know much about hair. But he said that Elsa's
case was extremely grave, and that in another week
she would have been entirely bald. She must take
a course of scalp friction; twelve applications for
three guineas the application. She took them; and
at the end of the course her hair was nearly all gone,
her temper was quite gone, her money was almost
gone, and she did not want to see anybody or to do
anything except die.</p>

<p>And then unwittingly she did what was best for
herself. To escape the sweet sympathy of her
friends and relations she went away all by herself
to live in a little cottage in a forest. It is good for
a girl who has been seeing too many people to live<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
all by herself for a while. It is good for a girl who
has been long in a crowded town to go away into the
forest solitude. Your soul must go to the cleaner,
just like your gloves.</p>

<p>Now that there was no one to sympathise with
her loss, and no one to attract by her beautiful hair
even if she had still had it, she could begin to think
of other things. And she thought about squirrels,
and nuts, and blackberries, and sunsets, and streams
that made silvery lines down the green hillsides.
And every morning she went all by herself to a
cottage two miles off and fetched milk for herself.</p>

<p>The old woman who kept the cows at this cottage
was tall and old and always polite, but also she was
always very sad. She had the face of one who never
ceased to suffer. After Elsa had been two months
in her cottage she suddenly saw that this woman had
always looked really sad. The sadness of other people
had never mattered to her in the least before; but now
one day she asked the old woman why this was,
and if there were anything that she might do for
her.</p>

<p>Then the old woman said: "I have a daughter
and she was very beautiful. None that saw her ever
forgot how beautiful she was. And she fell ill of a
strange disease so that her whole face became loathesome.
No one but I can bear to look on her, lest
their dreams should be haunted for ever."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>"And she lives here, this poor daughter of yours?"
asked Elsa.</p>

<p>"Yes; she lies in the room upstairs. They tell
me that she will now soon be dead."</p>

<p>"I will come up and talk to her," said Elsa, "and
help to nurse her, for you must often be away on
your farm."</p>

<p>"No," said the old woman, "that is too much
for you to do. I tell you that no one but myself can
bear it. You must not see her."</p>

<p>"Look," said Elsa. And then she took off the
big kerchief that she always wore over her head.
"I had pretty hair once," she said, "and I have lost
it all. I can bear anything, and I want to help you."</p>

<p>Then Elsa went upstairs into a room which was
darkened, and even in that dim light she could see
that this old woman's daughter, who was once very
beautiful, had now become painful to behold. Elsa
was frightened, but tried not to show it, and a girl
who is frightened and tries not to show it, very frequently
does not look nearly such a fool as she thinks.
She remained there a long time, and when she came
out her face was quite white, and she wanted to go
back to her cottage and cry.</p>

<p>But every day after that until the end came she
went to see the sick girl who loved and adored her.
And the end came one afternoon quite quietly. And
the old woman did not weep at that time, but she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
blessed Elsa and went out, for the cows were waiting
to be milked, and that must not be left.</p>

<p>Next morning when Elsa awoke it was very late, and
the sun was streaming into her room. For a while she
lay with her eyes closed, thinking over all that had
happened. Each visit to the sick girl had been a separate
terror to her, but now she grieved that the girl
was dead, and wondered in her mind if there were
none other for whom she might find something to do.</p>

<p>At last, since it was a shame to lie so late, she got
up, and, behold, masses of beautiful chestnut-coloured
hair fell far down over her white shoulders! She
rubbed her eyes and said that she must be dreaming.
But no, it had really happened. Her mirror echoed
the truth. The glory of her pretty head had come
back to it as strangely as it had gone. So that afternoon
she mused what she would do as, sitting in the
garden of her cottage, she made a wreath of white lilies.</p>

<p>And the next day she left her cottage in the wood
and went back to her own home; and her sisters
were all delighted to see her, and praised her beautiful
hair, and were glad that it had grown again so quickly.
Yet one of them said secretly to another: "Now
she will be as vain and horrible as ever."</p>

<p>But, as it happened, she was not vain and horrible;
she was really quite nice, so that the prince who married
her loved her as much for the sweetness of her heart
as for her angel's face and her beautiful long hair.</p>

<h2>THE WIDOWER</h2>


<p>The decision of Edward Morris to marry again
was one of the few practical things of his
record. He had married first at the age of eighteen
without the knowledge of his parents. His wife
died two years later. He had no children by her.
At her death he was desolate.</p>

<p>He was as desolate, that is, as one can be at twenty.
He was free from the annoying minor-poet habit of
advertising his afflictions, but it was quite clear to
himself that there was nothing more left. Yet it is
idle for a man to say he will stop when Nature, his
proprietor, says that he will go on. There is no
comedy at ninety, and there is no tragedy at twenty.
After he had deposited the remains of his wife in
Brompton cemetery&mdash;she had a strong aversion to
cremation and inwardly believed that it destroyed
the immortal soul&mdash;he went off into the country,
selecting a village where he knew nobody. Here he
learned by heart considerable portions of the poems
of Heine, neglected to return the call of the rector,
and bored himself profusely. It must not be understood
that he resented the boredom. That was what
life was to be in future, a continuous dreariness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
After a brief stay in the village he went off to Paris
to study art. At the time when he thought of giving
himself to music all noticed his ability in painting.
When he took to art they remembered that he had
musical talent. A year later, when he returned to
England to live the life of a hermit, to teach in song
what he had learned in sorrow, some said that he was
a lost artist, and some that he was a lost musician,
and others that he was a well-defined case of dilettantism.
It is, however, difficult to be a hermit in
London. London has many tentacles; it puts them
out and draws you into the liveliest part of itself.
A claim of relationship, an old friendship, a piece of
medical advice, a chance meeting&mdash;anything may
become a tentacle. Almost before he knows it the
misanthropical hermit is dragged from his shell and
is writing that he has much pleasure in accepting her
very kind invitation for the thirteenth, and wonders
if that man in Sackville Street will be able to make
him some evening clothes in time, his others being
not so much clothes as a relic of those pre-hermit
days when his wife, his only love, still lived and took
him out to dinners, and would have the glass down
in the hansoms. The thought that he resented this
last action at the time saddens him, but the acceptance
is posted. He is drawn into the vortex.</p>

<p>Once in, Edward Morris had to explain to himself
how he got there. Nobody else wanted any explana<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>tion.
Nobody else knew that the first time he took
his hostess in to dinner he looked down the long
table towards his host's right hand and remembered.
His explanation to himself was that he did it to avoid
comment. One could not wear one's heart on one's
coat sleeve. One must go somewhere and must
do something. One must unfortunately live, even
when the savour of life has gone. So he lived, and
in living the savour of life came back again.</p>

<p>It was on a muggy December evening that he
accompanied Lady Marchsea and her eminent husband
to a first-night performance. When the eminent
man was grumbling at the draught, and Lady
Marchsea was, with justification, admiring herself,
her dress, and everything that was hers, Edward
Morris looked up. Out of the gloom of the box
above him a brown-faced girl with dark eyes, her
chin leaning on her white gloves, bent forward and
looked down.</p>

<p>Yet it was not till the end of the first act that he
asked who she was and was told that she was nobody,
but was apparently with the Martins, who were very,
very dear friends, and would Mr Morris take her
round? That was the beginning of it, and the end
of it was his engagement to Adela Constantia Graham,
who was nobody. Everybody who knew Adela
Constantia knew that it was an excellent thing for
her&mdash;a much wealthier man than she had any reason<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
to expect. Everyone who knew Edward Morris
knew that it was the best thing for him. "Ballast,"
said Lady Marchsea, emphatically, "that is what
marriage means to a man like Edward Morris. He
needs ballast; something to make him concentrate
himself and trust himself; something to encourage
him and urge him on."</p>

<p>Her notions of the general uses of ballast were
vague, but her conviction was sincere that Edward
Morris, happily re-married, would achieve something
in one, or possibly in all, of the arts. Her eminent
husband said: "Nice sort of man, but no good
really." But still he paid for the dinner-service with
the sanctifying mark on the bottom of all the plates,
which they forwarded to Edward Morris a short time
before the wedding&mdash;the wedding which never took
place.</p>

<p>About a week before the date fixed for that wedding
it occurred to Edward Morris in a moment of
leisure&mdash;he was naturally very busy at the time&mdash;that
his first wife had been a jealous woman, and he
wondered what she would have thought and said if
she had been alive. He could laugh at the illogicality.
If she had been alive there would have been
nothing to think or to say. The haunting face with
the chin pressed on the white gloves against the
darkness at the back of the box would have been
merely a face and nothing more, and would not have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
haunted. He collected his old love-letters and
burned them. Other little relics of his first wife he
gathered together, had them placed in a box and deposited
at his bankers. The old life was done; the
new life was beginning. Yet one night as he stood
in a darkened room with Adela Constantia in his
arms the door opened with a little quick click some
few inches. She stepped back from him, thinking
it was a servant, and he turned white, thinking, in a
moment of madness, that it was someone else; then
he went to the door and opened it wider. No one
was there.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The position of the widower who marries again is
irritating to him if he be, as Edward Morris was, a
man of nice feeling. He has to say, and to believe,
that he loves as he never loved in his life before.
Scraps of used romance must be whipped up out of
his respectable past to set against the virginal fervour
of the young woman who has just begun to love him.
Yet he feels that all this is an insult to the dead&mdash;to
the woman who loved him before. A man of the
world has a happy habit of forgetting and of ignoring.
He may marry for the second or third time
quite easily. He takes nothing too seriously. He
may order a new overcoat, but he does not feel that
the coat will be worthless unless he swears and tries
to believe that he never wore a coat like that before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Morris, however, was a sentimentalist, and so he became
irritated with himself. The next step inevitably
followed. He became irritated with his dead
wife. She had got her cold arms round his neck and
was dragging him down and holding him back from
the joyful development of his life.</p>

<p>When in London it was his custom to visit her
grave in Brompton cemetery at regular intervals,
once every month. During his engagement to Adela
Constantia he made up his mind that this regular
visit must be dropped. Some arrangement could
be made to have the grave kept in decent order, but
he could not go near it again. He remembered
having been told a story of a widower who married
again and went hand-in-hand with his second wife
to stand by the grave of the first. It had been told
him as something pathetic. He had never been able
to see in it anything but a subject for a humorous
paper; Guy de Maupassant would have done
wonders with it. He settled the day when the last
visit should be made. He selected an appropriate
wreath, in which everlastings and dead leaves were
symbolically interwoven. But that afternoon more
than ever before his hatred to his dead wife grew
within him. He recollected her strange belief with
regard to cremation. Fire destroyed everything,
even the immortal soul, and it seemed as if fire
destroyed love too. He remembered that he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
burnt her letters. As he drove down Regent Street
an old friend, a man whom he had not seen for some
time, recognised him. He stopped the cab and his
friend came up.</p>

<p>"Why do I never see you now?" said the friend.
"But of course I know. Very much engaged aren't
you? (That's not bad for an impromptu, by the
way.) I suppose you are going there now?"</p>

<p>"No," said Morris, "as a matter of fact I am not."</p>

<p>"Well, you are evidently going somewhere, and
you carry a big box with you with a florist's label on
it, so all I can say is that if you are not going there
you ought to be."</p>

<p>Edward Morris laughed, and to laugh was the last
touch of horror.</p>

<p>"Well," the friend said, "if you are really not going
to see Miss Graham I have no scruples in annexing
you. Come round to the club for a game of billiards."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Morris, "I am afraid I am very
busy this afternoon."</p>

<p>However, he let himself be persuaded. The box
containing the wreath was left in the charge of the
hall-porter at the club. On the following day Morris
despatched the wreath to Brompton cemetery by a
messenger-boy, where the symbolical offering was
deposited on the grave of Charles Ernest Jessop,
who died at the age of two and a half, and of whose
death or previous existence Morris was unaware.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Messenger-boys are so careless. Morris never even
attempted to visit the cemetery again. It was not
only anger, it was not only hatred; it was also fear
that kept him away. He was assured in his own
mind that the dead woman was awake again and was
watching him jealously.</p>

<p>The moment when he had just awoken from sleep
was always a horrible one for him. The fear of the
dead woman was in his mind then and nothing else
was very clear. He left the electric light on all night
and, as a rule, slept fairly well and without any
haunting or painful dreams. But the moment of
waking was always a trial. He kept on expecting
to see something that he never did see. He would
not have wondered if, as he awoke, someone had
touched his hand, or the electric light had been
suddenly switched off.</p>

<p>Of course everybody noticed that he looked
wretchedly ill. Adela Constantia was in despair
about his health. There were things about him
which were very queer; that he did not like dark
rooms. That when he was talking to her he would
suddenly look over his shoulder&mdash;at nothing. The
comforting doctor told her that Morris has been very
busy indeed with the preparation for his married
life and, the doctor added, a lot of worry upsets the
nerves. This is quite true.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p><hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>On his wedding morning he certainly looked much
fitter to be buried than to be married. His best
man gave him champagne and told him to hold his
head up more. The bride made an adorable and
pathetic figure; a beautiful young girl is always a
pathetic figure on her wedding-morning. Her sisters
fluttered around her, ready to cry at the right
moments. Her father looked a little nervous and
elated. He had had quite a long talk with Lady
Marchsea, whose husband was kept away by the
toothache. The ceremony went with its customary
brilliance until that point when the bridegroom
was required to say: "I, Edward, take thee,
Adela Constantia." He said this in a loud voice,
but he did not say "Adela Constantia"; he gave
another name. There was a moment's pause, and
while everybody was looking at everybody he fainted
and fell.</p>

<p>At the inquest it was found that the blow on the
head from the sharp edge of the stone step satisfactorily
accounted for the death. All the evening
papers had readable paragraphs headed "Tragic
End to a Fashionable Wedding Ceremony."</p>

<p>And Adela Constantia married somebody else.</p>

<p>And the dead woman went to sleep again.</p>

<h2>THE UNFINISHED GAME</h2>


<p>At Tanslowe, which is on the Thames, I found
just the place that I wanted. I had been born
in the hotel business, brought up in it, and made my
living at it for thirty years. For the last twenty I
had been both proprietor and manager, and had
worked uncommonly hard, for it is personal attention
and plenty of it which makes a hotel pay. I might
have retired altogether, for I was a bachelor with
no claims on me and had made more money than
enough; but that was not what I wanted. I wanted
a nice, old-fashioned house, not too big, in a nice
place with a longish slack season. I cared very
little whether I made it pay or not. The Regency
Hotel at Tanslowe was just the thing for me. It
would give me a little to do and not too much.
Tanslowe was a village, and though there were two
or three public-houses, there was no other hotel in
the place, nor was any competition likely to come
along. I was particular about that, because my
nature is such that competition always sets me
fighting, and I cannot rest until the other shop goes
down. I had reached a time of life when I did want
to rest and did not want any more fighting. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
a free house, and I have always had a partiality for
being my own master. It had just the class of trade
that I liked&mdash;principally gentlefolk taking their
pleasure in a holiday on the river. It was very
cheap, and I like value for money. The house was
comfortable, and had a beautiful garden sloping down
to the river. I meant to put in some time in that
garden&mdash;I have a taste that way.</p>

<p>The place was so cheap that I had my doubts.
I wondered if it was flooded when the river rose, if
it was dropping to pieces with dry-rot, if the drainage
had been condemned, if they were going to start a
lunatic asylum next door, or what it was. I went
into all these points and a hundred more. I found
one or two trifling drawbacks, and one expects them
in any house, however good&mdash;especially when it is
an old place like the Regency. I found nothing
whatever to stop me from taking the place.</p>

<p>I bought the whole thing, furniture and all, lock,
stock and barrel, and moved in. I brought with me
my own head-waiter and my man-cook, Englishmen
both of them. I knew they would set the thing in
the right key. The head-waiter, Silas Goodheart,
was just over sixty, with grey hair and a wrinkled
face. He was worth more to me than two younger
men would have been. He was very precise and
rather slow in his movements. He liked bright
silver, clean table-linen, and polished glass. Arti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>ficial
flowers in the vases on his tables would have
given him a fit. He handled a decanter of old port
as if he loved it&mdash;which, as a matter of fact, he did.
His manner to visitors was a perfect mixture of
dignity, respect and friendliness. If a man did
not quite know what he wanted for dinner, Silas had
sympathetic and very useful suggestions. He took,
I am sure, a real pleasure in seeing people enjoy
their luncheon or dinner. Americans loved him,
and tipped him out of all proportion. I let him
have his own way, even when he gave the thing away.</p>

<p>"Is the coffee all right here?" a customer asked
after a good dinner.</p>

<p>"I cannot recommend it," said Silas. "If I
might suggest, sir, we have the Chartreuse of the
old French shipping."</p>

<p>I overheard that, but I said nothing. The coffee
was extract, for there was more work than profit
in making it good. As it was, that customer went
away pleased, and came back again and again, and
brought his friends too. Silas was really the only
permanent waiter. When we were busy I got one
or two foreigners from London temporarily. Silas
soon educated them. My cook, Timbs, was an
honest chap, and understood English fare. He
seemed hardly ever to eat, and never sat down to a
meal; he lived principally on beer, drank enough of it
to frighten you, and was apparently never the worse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
for it. And a butcher who tried to send him second-quality
meat was certain of finding out his mistake.</p>

<p>The only other man I brought with me was young
Harry Bryden. He always called me uncle, but as a
matter of fact he was no relation of mine. He was
the son of an old friend. His parents died when he
was seven years old and left him to me. It was about
all they had to leave. At this time he was twenty-two,
and was making himself useful. There was
nothing which he was not willing to do, and he could
do most things. He would mark at billiards, and
played a good game himself. He had run the kitchen
when the cook was away on his holiday. He had
driven the station-omnibus when the driver was
drunk one night. He understood book-keeping,
and when I got a clerk who was a wrong 'un, he was
on to him at once and saved me money. It was my
intention to make him take his proper place more
when I got to the Regency; for he was to succeed me
when I died. He was clever, and not bad-looking in
a gipsy-faced kind of way. Nobody is perfect, and
Harry was a cigarette-maniac. He began when he
was a boy, and I didn't spare the stick when I caught
him at it. But nothing I could say or do made any
difference; at twenty-two he was old enough and big
enough to have his own way, and his way was to
smoke cigarettes eternally. He was a bundle of
nerves, and got so jumpy sometimes that some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
people thought he drank, though he had never in his
life tasted liquor. He inherited his nerves from his
mother, but I daresay the cigarettes made them worse.</p>

<p>I took Harry down with me when I first thought
of taking the place. He went over it with me and
made a lot of useful suggestions. The old proprietor
had died eighteen months before, and the widow had
tried to run it for herself and made a mess of it. She
had just sense enough to clear out before things got
any worse. She was very anxious to go, and I
thought that might have been the reason why the
price was so low.</p>

<p>The billiard-room was an annexe to the house, with
no rooms over it. We were told that it wasn't used
once in a twelvemonth, but we took a look at it&mdash;we
took a look at everything. The room had got a
very neglected look about it. I sat down on the
platform&mdash;tired with so much walking and standing&mdash;and
Harry whipped the cover off the table. "This
was the one they had in the Ark," he said.</p>

<p>There was not a straight cue in the rack, the balls
were worn and untrue, the jigger was broken.
Harry pointed to the board. "Look at that, uncle,"
he said. "Noah had made forty-eight; Ham was
doing nicely at sixty-six; and then the Flood came
and they never finished." From neatness and force
of habit he moved over and turned the score back.
"You'll have to spend some money here. My word,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
if they put the whole lot in at a florin we're swindled."
As we came out Harry gave a shiver. "I wouldn't spend
a night in there," he said, "not for a five-pound note."</p>

<p>His nerves always made me angry. "That's a
very silly thing to say," I told him. "Who's going
to ask you to sleep in a billiard-room?"</p>

<p>Then he got a bit more practical, and began to calculate
how much I should have to spend to make a bright,
up-to-date billiard-room of it. But I was still angry.</p>

<p>"You needn't waste your time on that," I said,
"because the place will stop as it is. You heard
what Mrs Parker said&mdash;that it wasn't used once in a
twelvemonth. I don't want to attract all the loafers
in Tanslowe into my house. Their custom's worth
nothing, and I'd sooner be without it. Time enough
to put that room right if I find my staying visitors
want it, and people who've been on the river all day
are mostly too tired for a game after dinner."</p>

<p>Harry pointed out that it sometimes rained, and
there was the winter to think about. He had always
got plenty to say, and what he said now had sense in it.
But I never go chopping and changing about, and I had
made my mind up. So I told him he had got to learn
how to manage the house, and not to waste half his
time over the billiard-table. I had a good deal done
to the rest of the house in the way of redecorating
and improvements, but I never touched the annexe.</p>

<p>The next time I saw the room was the day after we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
moved in. I was alone, and I thought it certainly
did look a dingy hole as compared with the rest of the
house. Then my eye happened to fall on the board,
and it still showed sixty-six&mdash;forty-eight, as it had
done when I entered the room with Harry three
months before. I altered the board myself this time.
To me it was only a funny coincidence; another game
had been played there and had stopped exactly at
the same point. But I was glad Harry was not with
me, for it was the kind of thing that would have made
him jumpier than ever.</p>

<p>It was the summer time and we soon had something
to do. I had been told that motor-cars had cut into
the river trade a good deal; so I laid myself out for
the motorist. Tanslowe was just a nice distance for
a run from town before lunch. It was all in the old-fashioned
style, but there was plenty of choice and
the stuff was good; and my wine-list was worth consideration.
Prices were high, but people will pay
when they are pleased with the way they are treated.
Motorists who had been once came again and sent
their friends. Saturday to Monday we had as much
as ever we could do, and more than I had ever meant
to do. But I am built like that&mdash;once I am in a shop
I have got to run it for all it's worth.</p>

<p>I had been there about a month, and it was
about the height of our season, when one night, for
no reason that I could make out, I couldn't get to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
sleep. I had turned in, tired enough, at half-past
ten, leaving Harry to shut up and see the lights out,
and at a quarter past twelve I was still awake. I
thought to myself that a pint of stout and a biscuit
might be the cure for that. So I lit my candle and
went down to the bar. The gas was out on the staircase
and in the passages, and all was quiet. The
door into the bar was locked, but I had thought to
bring my pass-key with me. I had just drawn my
tankard of stout when I heard a sound that made
me put the tankard down and listen again.</p>

<p>The billiard-room door was just outside in the
passage, and there could not be the least doubt that
a game was going on. I could hear the click-click of
the balls as plainly as possible. It surprised me a
little, but it did not startle me. We had several staying
in the house, and I supposed two of them had
fancied a game. All the time that I was drinking the
stout and munching my biscuit the game went on&mdash;click,
click-click, click. Everybody has heard the
sound hundreds of times standing outside the glass-pannelled
door of a billiard-room and waiting for the
stroke before entering. No other sound is quite like it.</p>

<p>Suddenly the sound ceased. The game was over. I
had nothing on but my pyjamas and a pair of slippers,
and I thought I would get upstairs again before the
players came out. I did not want to stand there
shivering and listening to complaints about the table.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
I locked the bar, and took a glance at the billiard-room
door as I was about to pass it. What I saw
made me stop short. The glass panels of the door
were as black as my Sunday hat, except where they
reflected the light of my candle. The room, then,
was not lit up, and people do not play billiards in
the dark. After a second or two I tried the handle.
The door was locked. It was the only door to the
room.</p>

<p>I said to myself: "I'll go on back to bed. It must
have been my fancy, and there was nobody playing
billiards at all." I moved a step away, and then I
said to myself again: "I know perfectly well that a
game <i>was</i> being played. I'm only making excuses
because I'm in a funk."</p>

<p>That settled it. Having driven myself to it, I
moved pretty quickly. I shoved in my pass-key,
opened the door, and said "Anybody there?" in a
moderately loud voice that sounded somehow like
another man's. I am very much afraid that I should
have jumped if there had come any answer to my
challenge, but all was silent. I took a look round.
The cover was on the table. An old screen was leaning
against it; it had been put there to be out of the
way. As I moved my candle the shadows of things
slithered across the floor and crept up the walls. I
noticed that the windows were properly fastened,
and then, as I held my candle high, the marking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>-board
seemed to jump out of the darkness. The
score recorded was sixty-six&mdash;forty-eight.</p>

<p>I shut the door, locked it again, and went up to my
room. I did these things slowly and deliberately,
but I was frightened and I was puzzled. One is not
at one's best in the small hours.</p>

<p>The next morning I tackled Silas.</p>

<p>"Silas," I said, "what do you do when gentlemen
ask for the billiard-room?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said Silas, "I put them off if I can.
Mr Harry directed me to, the place being so much out
of order."</p>

<p>"Quite so," I said. "And when you can't put
them off?"</p>

<p>"Then they just try it, sir, and the table puts them
off. It's very bad. There's been no game played
there since we came."</p>

<p>"Curious," I said. "I thought I heard a game
going on last night."</p>

<p>"I've heard it myself, sir, several times. There
being no light in the room, I've put it down to a loose
ventilator. The wind moves it and it clicks."</p>

<p>"That'll be it," I said. Five minutes later I had
made sure that there was no loose ventilator in the
billiard-room. Besides, the sound of one ball striking
another is not quite like any other sound. I also
went up to the board and turned the score back,
which I had omitted to do the night before. Just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
then Harry passed the door on his way from the bar,
with a cigarette in his mouth as usual. I called him
in.</p>

<p>"Harry," I said, "give me thirty, and I'll play you
a hundred up for a sovereign. You can tell one of the
girls to fetch our cues from upstairs."</p>

<p>Harry took his cigarette out of his mouth and
whistled. "What, uncle!" he said. "Well, you're
going it, I don't think. What would you have said
to me if I'd asked you for a game at ten in the
morning?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" I said, "but this is all in the way of business.
I can't see much wrong with the table, and if
I can play on it, then other people may. There's a
chance to make a sovereign for you anyhow. You've
given me forty-five and a beating before now."</p>

<p>"No, uncle," he said, "I wouldn't give you thirty.
I wouldn't give you one. The table's not playable.
Luck would win against Roberts on it."</p>

<p>He showed me the faults of the thing and said he
was busy. So I told him if he liked to lose the chance
of making a sovereign he could.</p>

<p>"I hate that room," he said, as we came out.
"It's not too clean, and it smells like a vault."</p>

<p>"It smells a lot better than your cigarettes," I said.</p>

<p>For the next six weeks we were all busy, and I gave
little thought to the billiard-room. Once or twice I
heard old Silas telling a customer that he could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
recommend the table, and that the whole room was
to be redecorated and refitted as soon as we got the
estimates. "You see, sir, we've only been here a
little while, and there hasn't been time to get everything
as we should like it quite yet."</p>

<p>One day Mrs Parker, the woman who had the
Regency before me, came down from town to see how
we were getting on. I showed the old lady round,
pointed out my improvements, and gave her a bit of
lunch in my office.</p>

<p>"Well, now," I said, as she sipped her glass of port
afterwards, "I'm not complaining of my bargain,
but isn't the billiard-room a bit queer?"</p>

<p>"It surprises me," she said, "that you've left it as
it is. Especially with everything else going ahead,
and the yard half full of motors. I should have taken
it all down myself if I'd stopped. That iron roof's
nothing but an eyesore, and you might have a couple
of beds of geraniums there and improve the look of
your front."</p>

<p>"Let's see," I said. "What was the story about
that billiard-room?"</p>

<p>"What story do you mean?" she said, looking at
me suspiciously.</p>

<p>"The same one you're thinking of," I said.</p>

<p>"About that man, Josiah Ham?"</p>

<p>"That's it."</p>

<p>"Well, I shouldn't worry about that if I were you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
That was all thirty years ago, and I doubt if there's
a soul in Tanslowe knows it now. Best forgotten, I
say. Talk of that kind doesn't do a hotel any good.
Why, how did you come to hear of it?"</p>

<p>"That's just it," I said. "The man who told me
was none too clear. He gave me a hint of it. He
was an old commercial passing through, and had
known the place in the old days. Let's hear your
story and see if it agrees with his."</p>

<p>But I had told my fibs to no purpose. The old
lady seemed a bit flustered. "If you don't mind, Mr
Sanderson, I'd rather not speak of it."</p>

<p>I thought I knew what was troubling her. I filled
her glass and my own. "Look here," I said. "When
you sold the place to me it was a fair deal. You
weren't called upon to go thirty years back, and no
reasonable man would expect it. I'm satisfied.
Here I am, and here I mean to stop, and twenty
billiard-rooms wouldn't drive me away. I'm not
complaining. But, just as a matter of curiosity, I'd
like to hear your story."</p>

<p>"What's your trouble with the room?"</p>

<p>"Nothing to signify. But there's a game played
there and marked there&mdash;and I can't find the players,
and it's never finished. It stops always at sixty-six&mdash;forty-eight."</p>

<p>She gave a glance over her shoulder. "Pull the
place down," she said. "You can afford to do it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
and I couldn't." She finished her port. "I must
be going, Mr Sanderson. There's rain coming on,
and I don't want to sit in the train in my wet things.
I thought I would just run down to see how you were
getting on, and I'm sure I'm glad to see the old place
looking up again."</p>

<p>I tried again to get the story out of her, but she
ran away from it. She had not got the time, and it was
better not to speak of such things. I did not worry
her about it much, as she seemed upset over it.</p>

<p>I saw her across to the station, and just got back
in time. The rain came down in torrents. I stood
there and watched it, and thought it would do my
garden a bit of good. I heard a step behind me and
looked round. A fat chap with a surly&nbsp;face stood there,
as if he had just come out of the coffee-room. He was
the sort that might be a gentleman and might not.</p>

<p>"Afternoon, sir," I said. "Nasty weather for
motoring."</p>

<p>"It is," he said. "Not that I came in a motor.
You the proprietor, Mr Sanderson?"</p>

<p>"I am," I said. "Came here recently."</p>

<p>"I wonder if there's any chance of a game of
billiards."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," I said. "Table's shocking.
I'm having it all done up afresh, and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's it matter?" said he. "I don't care.
It's something to do, and one can't go out."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," I said, "if that's the case, I'll give you a
game, sir. But I'm no flyer at it at the best of times,
and I'm all out of practice now."</p>

<p>"I'm no good myself. No good at all. And I'd
be glad of the game."</p>

<p>At the billiard-room door I told him I'd fetch a
couple of decent cues. He nodded and went in.</p>

<p>When I came back with my cue and Harry's, I
found the gas lit and the blinds drawn, and he was
already knocking the balls about.</p>

<p>"You've been quick, sir," I said, and offered him
Harry's cue. But he refused and said he would keep
the one he had taken from the rack. Harry would
have sworn if he had found that I had lent his cue to a
stranger, so I thought that was just as well. Still,
it seemed to me that a man who took a twisted cue
by preference was not likely to be an expert.</p>

<p>The table was bad, but not so bad as Harry had
made out. The luck was all my side. I was fairly
ashamed of the flukes I made, one after the other.
He said nothing, but gave a short, loud laugh once or
twice&mdash;it was a nasty-sounding laugh. I was at
thirty-seven when he was nine, and I put on eleven
more at my next visit and thought I had left him
nothing.</p>

<p>Then the fat man woke up. He got out of his first
difficulty, and after that the balls ran right for him.
He was a player, too, with plenty of variety and re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>source,
and I could see that I was going to take a
licking. When he had reached fifty-one, an unlucky
kiss left him an impossible position. But I miscued,
and he got going again. He played very, very carefully
now, taking a lot more time for consideration
than he had done in his previous break. He seemed
to have got excited over it, and breathed hard, as fat
men do when they are worked up. He had kept his
coat on, and his face shone with perspiration.</p>

<p>At sixty-six he was in trouble again; he walked
round to see the exact position, and chalked his cue.
I watched him rather eagerly, for I did not like the
score. I hoped he would go on. His cue slid
back to strike, and then dropped with a clatter
from his hand. The fat man was gone&mdash;gone, as
I looked at him, like a flame blown out, vanished
into nothing.</p>

<p>I staggered away from the table. I began to back
slowly towards the door, meaning to make a bolt for
it. There was a click from the scoring-board, and I
saw the thing marked up. And then&mdash;I am thankful
to say&mdash;the billiard-room door opened, and I saw
Harry standing there. He was very white and shaky.
Somehow, the fact that he was frightened helped to
steady me.</p>

<p>"Good heavens, uncle!" he gasped, "I've been
standing outside. What's the matter? What's
happened?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing's the matter," I said sharply. "What
are you shivering about?" I swished back the
curtain, and sent up the blind with a snap. The rain
was over now, and the sun shone in through the wet
glass&mdash;I was glad of it.</p>

<p>"I thought I heard voices&mdash;laughing&mdash;somebody
called the score."</p>

<p>I turned out the gas. "Well," I said, "this table's
enough to make any man laugh, when it don't make
him swear. I've been trying your game of one hand
against another, and I daresay I called the score out
loud. It's no catch&mdash;not even for a wet afternoon. I'm
not both-handed, like the apes and Harry Bryden."</p>

<p>Harry is as good with the left hand as the right,
and a bit proud of it. I slid my own cue back into
its case. Then, whistling a bit of a tune, I picked up
the stranger's cue, which I did not like to touch. I
nearly&nbsp;dropped it again when I saw the initials "J.H."
on the butt. "Been trying the cues," I said, as I
put it in the rack. He looked at me as if he
were going to ask more questions. So I put
him on to something else. "We've not got
enough cover for those motor-cars," I said.
"Lucky we hadn't got many here in this rain.
There's plenty of room for another shed, and it
needn't cost much. Go and see what you can make
of it. I'll come out directly, but I've got to talk to
that girl in the bar first."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>He went off, looking rather ashamed of his
tremors.</p>

<p>I had not really very much to say to Miss Hesketh
in the bar. I put three fingers of whisky in a glass
and told her to put a dash of soda on the top of it.
That was all. It was a full-sized drink and did me
good.</p>

<p>Then I found Harry in the yard. He was figuring
with pencil on the back of an envelope. He was
always pretty smart where there was anything practical
to deal with. He had spotted where the shed
was to go, and he was finding what it would cost at a
rough estimate.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "if I went on with that idea of
mine about the flower-beds it needn't cost much
beyond the labour."</p>

<p>"What idea?"</p>

<p>"You've got a head like a sieve. Why, carrying
on the flower-beds round the front where the billiard-room
now stands. If we pulled that down it would
give us all the materials we want for the new motor-shed.
The roofing's sound enough, for I was up
yesterday looking into it."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't think you mentioned it to me, but
it's a rare good idea."</p>

<p>"I'll think about it," I said.</p>

<p>That evening my cook, Timbs, told me he'd be
sorry to leave me, but he was afraid he'd find the place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
too slow for him&mdash;not enough doing. Then old
Silas informed me that he hadn't meant to retire
so early, but he wasn't sure&mdash;the place was livelier
than he had expected, and there would be more
work than he could get through. I asked no questions.
I knew the billiard-room was somehow
or other at the bottom of it, and so it turned out.
In three days' time the workmen were in the
house and bricking up the billiard-room door; and
after that Timbs and old Silas found the Regency
suited them very well after all. And it was not just
to oblige Harry, or Timbs, or Silas that I had the
alteration made. That unfinished game was in my
mind; I had played it, and wanted never to play it
again. It was of no use for me to tell myself that it
had all been a delusion, for I knew better. My
health was good, and I had no delusions. I had
played it with Josiah Ham&mdash;with the lost soul of
Josiah Ham&mdash;and that thought filled me not with
fear, but with a feeling of sickness and disgust.</p>

<p>It was two years later that I heard the story of
Josiah Ham, and it was not from old Mrs Parker.
An old tramp came into the saloon bar begging, and
Miss Hesketh was giving him the rough side of her
tongue.</p>

<p>"Nice treatment!" said the old chap. "Thirty
years ago I worked here, and made good money, and
was respected, and now it's insults."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>And then I struck in. "What did you do here?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"Waited at table and marked at billiards."</p>

<p>"Till you took to drink?" I said.</p>

<p>"Till I resigned from a strange circumstance."</p>

<p>I sent him out of the bar, and took him down the
garden, saying I'd find him an hour or two's work.
"Now, then," I said, as soon as I had got him alone,
"what made you leave?"</p>

<p>He looked at me curiously. "I expect you know,
sir," he said. "Sixty-six. Unfinished."</p>

<p>And then he told me of a game played in that old
billiard-room on a wet summer afternoon thirty years
before. He, the marker, was one of the players.
The other man was a commercial traveller, who used
the house pretty regularly. "A fat man, ugly-looking,
with a nasty laugh. Josiah Ham his name was.
He was at sixty-six when he got himself into a tight
place. He moved his ball&mdash;did it when he thought
I wasn't looking. But I saw it in the glass, and I told
him of it. He got very angry. He said he wished
he might be struck dead if he ever touched the ball."</p>

<p>The old tramp stopped. "I see," I said.</p>

<p>"They said it was apoplexy. It's known to be
dangerous for fat men to get very angry. But I'd
had enough of it before long. I cleared out, and so
did the rest of the servants."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "we're not so superstitious nowa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>days.
And what brought you down in the
world?"</p>

<p>"It would have driven any man to it," he said.
"And once the habit is formed&mdash;well, it's there."</p>

<p>"If you keep off it I can give you a job weeding
for three days."</p>

<p>He did not want the work. He wanted a shilling,
and he got it; and I saw to it that he did not spend
it in my house.</p>

<p>We have got a very nice billiard-room upstairs now.
Two new tables and everything ship-shape. You
may find Harry there most evenings. It is all right.
But I have never taken to billiards again myself.</p>

<p>And where the old billiard-room was there are
flower-beds. The pansies that grow there have got
funny markings&mdash;like figures.</p>

<h2>SPARKLING BURGUNDY</h2>


<p>In London a day in mid-August drew to its close.
The air was motionless, the pavements were hot.
Weary children came home with the perambulator
from the sand-pit of Regent's Park or the playground
of Kensington Gardens. Young men from the city
wore straw hats and thronged the outside of motor-omnibuses.
Oxford Street, that singularly striving
street, was still striving, still exhibiting some of its
numerous activities. Starting from a humble and
Holborn origin, it lives to touch the lips of Park Lane,
but it goes to Bayswater when it dies. It was still
protesting that it was not tired and still crowded
with traffic. Irregular masses of buildings and heavy
dusty trees stood out darkly against a sky of fainting
lettuce colour. Young Mrs Bablove noticed them as
she came out of the Tube station, drawing her cloak
round her unwonted evening-dress. "Yes," said her
husband, as she called his attention to the effect.
"Striking." It was scarcely a minute's walk from
the station to the Restaurant Merveilleux, where they
were to be the guests of Mr Albert Carver.</p>

<p>The Restaurant Merveilleux does its best. It has
an arc-lamp and a medium-sized commissionaire. It
bears its name proudly in gilt letters a foot and a half<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
high. In the entrance are bay trees in green tubs
and a framed bill of our celebrated <i>diner du jour</i> at
half-a-crown. Within are little tables brightly appointed
and many electric lights. A mahogany
screen is carved with challenging pine-apples and
grapes, and against it is a table for six. Mr Carver
had reserved this table. Yet somehow one gets the
correct impression that this is a small eating-house
under Italian proprietorship.</p>

<p>The occasion of the little dinner given by this
bachelor and <i>viveur</i> was the engagement of Ada
Bunting to Harold Simcox. Albert Carver had received
much hospitality from Miss Bunting's parents.
He had as nearly as possible got engaged to Miss
Bunting himself, and now knew what the condemned
man feels like who is unexpectedly reprieved. Miss
Bunting and Mr Simcox were the guests of importance.
She was lymphatic and pale-haired; her future
husband was smaller and a shade shorter than she.
He concentrated on politeness, and made anyone to
whom he spoke feel like a possible customer. As for
Mr and Mrs Bablove, Mr Albert Carver had always
intended to ask them, if he ever asked anybody. He
frankly admired young Mrs Bablove, and said so, and
was slightly pleased when this created surprise and
it was suggested that she was hardly his type. It
seemed to imply that Mr Carver was a problem, and
this was subtly flattering to Mr Carver&mdash;who, if a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
problem, was singularly soluble. It is true none the
less that the women whom Albert Carver admired
were mostly fleshy and exuberant. Mrs Bablove
looked like an angel who had gone into domestic
service&mdash;a soul in servitude. She had to make a just-sufficient
income suffice, and as she was devoted to
her husband and her two little boys she did a good
deal of work herself. She had a sweet and rather
childish nature, was not without some true &aelig;sthetic
perception, and under less stringent limitations
might have developed further. Mr Bablove, a very
quiet and prosaic man, who wore spectacles only
when he was reading, made about the same income
as Mr Carver. They both held responsible positions
in the same firm. They both lived in the same street
in the Shepherd's Bush neighbourhood. But Mr
Bablove's income had to provide for a household,
and Mr Albert Carver's income was all ear-marked for
Mr Albert Carver. There was less splendour in Mr
Bablove's house than in Mr Carver's wicked flat with
the hookah (from the cut-price tobacconist) standing
on the low inlaid table and the French photogravure
of a bathing subject over the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>The remaining guest was Miss Adela Holmes. She
was beautiful and looked Oriental. Her movements
(after office-hours) were slow and very graceful. Her
voice was soft and languorous; her eyes also spoke.
During the day she was the third quickest typist in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
London, and ran her own office strictly on business
lines. Mr Carver in his light way would sometimes
call her "Nirvana"; he was convinced that this was
an Eastern term of endearment, and, though an allusion
to her appearance, permissible in a platonic
friend who had known her for years.</p>

<p>Mr Carver surveyed his little party with pleasure.
It was not the celebrated half-crown dinner that was
being served for this Lucullus; it was the rich man's
alternative&mdash;the <i>diner de luxe</i> at four-and-six. Mr
Carver always said that if he did a thing at all he
liked to do it well. He was a man of middle stature
and middle age. His hair was very black and intensely
smooth. His face suggested a commercial
Napoleon. He was dressed with some elaboration;
pink coral buttons constrained his white waistcoat
over a slight protuberance. Other diners at other
tables were not so dressed&mdash;not dressed for the evening
at all. One blackguard had entered in a suit of
flannels and a straw hat. But other tables had not
the profusion of smilax and carnations which graced
the table reserved for Mr Carver's party. A paper
simulation of chrysanthemums was good enough for
the half-crowners. How could they expect the eager
attendance given to Mr Carver's party? The frock-coated
proprietor hovered near the mahogany screen.
The head-waiter, at a side-table, took the neck of a
bottle of sparkling burgundy between his dusky<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
hands and caused it to rotate vigorously in the ice-pail.
This does not really make that curious wine any the
worse. Another waiter handed up for Mr Carver's
approval the <i>chef's</i> attempt to make a lobster look
like a sunset on the Matterhorn.</p>

<p>"Looks almost too good to eat," said Adela
Holmes, drowsily.</p>

<p>Mr Carver laughed joyously. "Think so, Nirvana?
Well, we'll try it."</p>

<p>The wonder had not yet quite gone out of the soft
brown eyes of Dora Bablove. This was luxury
indeed. It was a new way of living that she had never
known; in the course of her married life she had dined
out very rarely, and never after this manner. Somehow
she felt as if she was not Dora Bablove at all.</p>

<p>The proprietor made a suggestion to Mr Carver.
"Good idea, signor," said Mr Carver. "You'd like
an electric fan, Mrs Bablove, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>It was done in a moment. An electric lamp was
taken out, and something plugged in its place. A
gentle whirr, with a hint of an aeroplane in it. A cool
breeze that fluttered the pendent smilax.</p>

<p>"I think you're being very well looked after,"
said Mrs Bablove, timidly.</p>

<p>"You've got it," said Mr Carver, with conviction.
"That's just the advantage of a little place like this.
I'm here pretty often, and the signor knows me; and&mdash;oh,
well, I daresay he thinks it worth his while to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
keep my custom. I assure you I get an amount of personal
attention here that I never get at the Ritz." As
Mr Carver had never been to the Ritz this is credible.</p>

<p>"I like being looked after," said Mrs Bablove.
"I like to think that so many people are taking so
much trouble to please me."</p>

<p>"I should think&mdash;er&mdash;that that must always happen,"
said the polite Mr Simcox on her other side.</p>

<p>"Not a bit," laughed Dora. "As a rule, I take
all the trouble. Ask Teddy if I don't."</p>

<p>But nobody asked Teddy. Mr Bablove was discussing
palmistry with Miss Bunting, who thought there
might be something in it, and with Miss Holmes,
who was quite expert and offered to read his hand.</p>

<p>Mr Carver said, in his whimsical way, that he thought
Mrs Bablove should drink and forget it. He watched
her as she touched with her full lips the magenta foam
in her glass. He had never seen Mrs Bablove in a low
dress before; certainly she had a charm. The conversation
grew animated. The question of London in
August was settled. London empty? Not a bit of it.
That was the old idea. Why, this year, with the House
sitting, half the best people were still in London. You
could walk through Mayfair and see for yourself.</p>

<p>Mrs Bablove was not deeply interested in the question.
She knew that Teddy and Mr Carter would
take their holidays just when the firm decided. She
was more interested in the people in the room. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
blackguard in the flannel suit had finished his lager
and had attempted to light a pipe; it had been
politely explained to him that pipes were not permissible.
At a little table in the corner were a man with
a saturnine face and a very young girl in red. They
drank champagne, talked low and confidentially, and
paid no attention to anybody. Dora Bablove had
strayed into a world previously unexplored by her.</p>

<p>More and more the conviction came on her that
the Dora who was unwrapping the vine-leaf from the
fat quail on her plate was not the Dora who had been
married six years, who looked after her two little
boys so well, who mended, and cleaned, and did
rather clever things with the rest of the cold mutton.
She was for the moment a woman untrammelled by
circumstances. She delighted in it, enjoyed it desperately,
and was half afraid of it. Had this Dora quite
the same ideas about&mdash;well, about what was right?</p>

<p>The girl in red had lit a cigarette now, and she was
getting rather angry with the man who was with her.
Dora thought he was making her angry on purpose.
She wondered why. She asked Mr Carver.</p>

<p>Mr Carver shook his head. A mistake to make
the ladies angry&mdash;that was what he always thought.
But some of them had tempers. Now&mdash;well, he
mustn't say that.</p>

<p>"Oh, go on, you must," said Dora.</p>

<p>"Well, I was only going to say that appearances<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
are deceptive. You look at first sight as if you had
the most placid nature in the world. But I think you
could get angry, Mrs Bablove&mdash;very angry."</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Quite wrong. Whatever makes you
think that?"</p>

<p>"There's a look in the eyes sometimes. Oh, I assure
you it makes me very careful," laughed Mr Carver.
"Frightens me. Now, really, Mrs Bablove, you
must have a little yellow Chartreuse with your coffee."</p>

<p>But Mrs Bablove was resolute in her refusal. She
did not care in the least about such things. She had
drunk one glass of the sparkling burgundy, not to be
out of the picture, and after that had sipped iced
water. At the other end of the table "Nirvana"
was saying that she didn't see why she shouldn't&mdash;two
other women in the room had set the example.
And with that she accepted a cigarette from Mr
Bablove's silver case. The smoke wandered gently
through the smilax plantation, and left hurriedly
when it met the electric fan.</p>

<p>And now Mr Simcox had to take Miss Bunting
home, for Miss Bunting lived in remote Wimbledon
and in an early household, and the privilege of the
latch-key was not accorded to her. Mr Simcox, who
had not refused the yellow Chartreuse or anything
else, was slightly flushed and more polite than ever.
He assured his host that it had been the pleasantest
evening of his life and he should never forget it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Even the lymphatic Miss Bunting had become quite
animated. At the beginning of the dinner they had
maintained towards one another a pre-concerted air of
dignified reserve, but that was now quite broken down.</p>

<p>Mr Carver rose to see them to their cab. "And
if anybody else tries to go," he said to the rest of his
guests, "I shall lose my temper."</p>

<p>"Might have got a box at one of the halls if I'd
thought about it," said Mr Carver on his return. It
was a well-meant effort of the imagination. He
might, but it would have been unlike him.</p>

<p>"Much pleasanter where we are," said Miss Holmes,
languorously. "Performances always bore me."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, Nirvana," said Mr Carver, "so long as
you're pleased&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Holmes turned again to Mr Bablove. His
wife hoped that Teddy was not being too prosaic.
From a word or two she caught she knew he was talking
politics. But Miss Holmes did not look bored.
Perhaps she was interested in politics too.</p>

<p>"Why do you call her Nirvana?" Mrs Bablove
asked, dropping her voice a little. But the couple at
the further end of the table were absorbed in their
talk now and taking no notice of what the others were
saying.</p>

<p>"Why do I call her Nirvana? Because she looks
like a gipsy. She does, doesn't she?"</p>

<p>Mr Carver's fruity voice had also become discreet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know. I think she looks charming."</p>

<p>"Do you?" said Mr Carver. "I'd like to talk to
you about that. Not now&mdash;presently." He knew
the value of a slight hint of mystery. "Have a
cigarette now, Mrs Bablove?"</p>

<p>"Thanks. I think I will."</p>

<p>"Why wouldn't you smoke before?" he asked as
he lit the cigarette for her.</p>

<p>"Too many people. The room's nearly empty
now. I'm not so brave as&mdash;Nirvana."</p>

<p>"I don't think you quite know what you are.
You're full of possibilities."</p>

<p>"I like these cigarettes," said Dora. "Teddy
gives me one sometimes, though I don't often smoke,
but his are not quite so nice as these."</p>

<p>Mr Carver became informative on the subject of
Turkish tobacco, but with the information he wove
much which was personal. It appeared that it was
Mr Carver's ambition to leave business and London
and to spend the rest of his life in Japan.</p>

<p>"I thought you were devoted to London," said
Mrs Bablove. "What you say rather surprises me."</p>

<p>"I surprise myself sometimes," said Mr Carver,
darkly.</p>

<p>A little later all rose to go.</p>

<p>A hansom was waiting just outside, and Mr Carver
began to organise briskly.</p>

<p>"Will you take Miss Holmes in that cab, Teddy?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
It's scarcely two minutes out of your way. I'll
bring Mrs Bablove in the next cab."</p>

<p>Mr Carver took it all for granted, and it was done
as he suggested. The next cab was a taxi.</p>

<p>"We shall be home before them," laughed Dora
as she got into the cab. "By the way, Mr Carver,
what were you going to tell me about Nirvana?"</p>

<p>And presently Mr Carver was saying why Miss
Holmes could not seem charming when Dora Bablove
was present. He compared them in some detail.
"I don't think you know enough about yourself," he
said. "That delicious mouth of yours!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When they reached Mrs Bablove's house Dora did
not ask Mr Carver to come in. She thanked him and
said good-night rather briefly. She switched on the
light in the hall, ran upstairs to see that her two little
boys were safely asleep, and came down to the dining-room
to wait for her husband.</p>

<p>She poured out a glass of water and drank it. Then
she sat quite still in the easy-chair with her head in
her hands. What was she to do? What on earth
was she to do? A man had kissed her on the lips&mdash;a
man who was not her husband. She had let him do
it. She thought&mdash;she hardly knew&mdash;that her lips
had answered to his. Such a thing had never happened
to her before. She was wide awake now. But
surely in the cab she must have been half asleep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>She had leaned back with her eyes half-closed,
suffused with a pleasant warmth and tiredness, and
had heard his caressing voice praising her as she had
never before been praised. She had not guessed that
he thought so much of her&mdash;that he admired her so
much. Then as he spoke of the beauty of her hands,
he took one of her hands in his. She knew what
would come, and was without any power to prevent
it. She had seen his face come near to her own and&mdash;no,
she would tell the truth to herself. For a
moment she had gone mad and let herself go completely.
She had wanted to be kissed, and as she felt
his lips upon her own her kiss had met his.</p>

<p>True, the next moment she had recovered herself;
she chatted gaily, was merely amused when Mr Carver
would have been sentimental, and would not let him
get near her. Her one reference to what had happened
was as the cab neared her own door. She said,
"You know what you did when I had fallen asleep.
Never try to do it again. And never speak of it to
me. I couldn't forgive it twice, you know. To-night
I've&mdash;I made some allowance for&mdash;well, here
we are. I must get out."</p>

<p>She was not troubled about Mr Carver. She had
told him that she was asleep, and had implied that he
was under the influence of wine. She felt that she
could always manage Mr Carver.</p>

<p>But what about Teddy? He must never, never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
know. It was one little slip, one moment of madness,
and it would never happen again. It would be
wicked to let Teddy know and to make him wretched.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if she did not tell him, how was
she to quiet the voice of conscience? What became of
their mutual confidence? She felt that she could
never be happy again until she had told all and been
forgiven.</p>

<p>She took the thing tragically. She saw the whole
of her own happiness and Teddy's happiness ruined
by that one moment of madness and the future
of the little boys seriously imperilled. She was just
wondering who, in the event of a separation, would
have the custody of the children, when she heard the
sound of Teddy's hansom as it stopped at the door.</p>

<p>What on earth was she to do? She could never
face him. She would just burst into tears and tell
him everything.</p>

<p>But she found herself quite unable to carry out this
decision. Teddy looked so cheerful. He talked more
than usual. How had she liked it? A rare good
dinner, it seemed to him. And she had been by far
the prettiest woman there. He had felt proud of her.</p>

<p>She smiled sadly, and said that he was prejudiced.
"And how did you get on with Miss Holmes?"</p>

<p>"Oh, all right. The trouble with her is that she's
rather affected, and affectation is just one of those
things that I can't stand."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>If only for one moment he would take his eyes off
her. She felt distraught. She hardly knew what
she was saying. She observed that sparkling Burgundy
seemed rather a heady wine. He hastened to
agree with her.</p>

<p>"I didn't take much of it. To tell the truth, it's
not a wine I ever met before, and the taste seemed to
me rather funny. I'd sooner have a whisky-and-soda
any day."</p>

<p>"Have one now. Do. Why not? I'll run up to
bed because I'm so tired. I daresay I shall be asleep
by the time you come."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shan't be long," said Teddy, and Dora
managed to get out of the room without being kissed.</p>

<p>The moment she had gone Teddy's cheerfulness
vanished. He mixed himself a very stiff whisky-and-soda,
and sipped gloomily, staring at the dead
cigarette between his fingers.</p>

<p>Dora panted as she undressed. Tragedy seemed
to be choking her. She hurried into bed. When
Teddy came up she pretended to be asleep, but she
got little sleep that night.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Two days had passed and Dora had not spoken.
There were dark lines under her eyes, and she seldom
smiled. Teddy, always kind, had been kinder to
her than ever. He said complimentary things to her.
Every evening he brought her fruit from the city,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
because she liked fruit; it was expensive fruit too.
And every kind word or act seemed to cut her heart
like a knife. She felt so unworthy of devotion.
The position was unendurable, and on the third
morning as they rose from breakfast she suddenly
determined to end it there and then&mdash;to tell him
everything and throw herself on his mercy.</p>

<p>"I want to speak to you for a minute before you
go to the city," she said. "Will you come into the
drawing-room?"</p>

<p>"Very well," said Teddy.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room she found that she was shaking
all over and had to sit down. She was thinking
how she would begin, when she heard a hollow voice
say, "Wait. You need say nothing." It was
Teddy's voice.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked in a choked whisper.</p>

<p>"Do you think I haven't seen?" said Teddy,
almost fiercely. "You guessed it somehow when
I came into the house that night. I suppose a bad
conscience gives itself away. I thought you knew
when you asked me how I got on with Miss Holmes.
These last two days you've been upset. You've not
been yourself. And that of course made me certain
you knew. Only let me tell you how I came to do it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Dora, with great self-possession, "tell
me that."</p>

<p>"Well, she was talking about the loneliness of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
life. It was as much pity as anything. And the
cab was going down a dark street at the time.
Mind, I only kissed her once. And the moment I
did it I&mdash;I was ashamed of myself. You don't know
what I've been through."</p>

<p>Dora thought she did, but she said nothing.</p>

<p>"I swear that I care for no woman in the world but
you, Dora. I'm awfully sorry I've hurt you like this.
Can you ever forgive me?"</p>

<p>Dora rose, and placed both hands on his shoulders.
"Could you have forgiven me," she said, "if I had
let a man kiss me?"</p>

<p>He paused a moment. "Yes, Dora," he said, "I
think so."</p>

<p>Her face was like the face of an angel. "Then,
Teddy dear, I forgive you absolutely. We will
never speak of this again. And it will never happen
again, will it?"</p>

<p>"Never," said the repentant sinner, and kissed her.</p>

<p>Mrs Bablove sang happily as she helped to make
the beds that morning.</p>

<p>And they never did speak of it again. Once, two
years later&mdash;this was after poor Aunt Mary had been
called to her rest and the Babloves had become prosperous
in consequence&mdash;Teddy gave it as his opinion
that there was only one sparkling wine worth consideration
and that wine was champagne. Dora cordially
agreed with him, but changed the subject rapidly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE ACT OF HEROISM</h2>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Do not go outside your part, for whatever part in
life you may be cast. If you are Nature's low
comedian, do not usurp the business of the hero.
Hear the plain story of Alfred Smithers, who stood
five foot eight, had sandy hair and an apologetic eye,
earned four pounds a week by book-keeping, and was
a good husband until by the merest chance he was led
into the paths of heroism.</p>

<p>Chance plays the devil at times. Emily Trimmins,
housemaid by profession and hysterical by nature,
found that the postman was walking out with another
lady. Consulting her recollection of penny romances
she saw that suicide was clearly indicated. The
relics of sense which distinguish hysteria from madness
made her choose the manner of her suicide.
She went up on to the Heath one afternoon and flung
herself into a pond, in the presence of several philosophical
male loafers, one emotional nursemaid, and
two fat-headed children. Her last thought as she
entered the water was which of the male loafers
would pull her out again.</p>

<p>The first loafer said that was as silly an act as ever
he saw, and he should be moving home. The second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
loafer observed that something ought to be done at
once. The third called for help. The fourth said
the police were never there when they were wanted.</p>

<p>The emotional nursemaid sat down at once on the
grass, removed her hat, unhooked her dress at the
neck, fanned herself with a handkerchief, and said,
"Oh! that <i>has</i> give me a turn!"</p>

<p>The two fat-headed children cried, "Ain't that
funny? Nurse, make her come out and do it again.
Nurse, ain't that funny? Nurse, make her come out
and do it again." <i>Da capo.</i></p>

<p>And at this moment chance&mdash;playing the devil as
aforesaid&mdash;brought upon the scene Alfred Smithers,
who had fished the pond and believed the depth
nowhere exceeded three feet, who saw a policeman
with a coil of rope under his arm rapidly approaching,
who observed that he had an audience and was
accordingly inspirited.</p>

<p>"Go in from where you are!" shouted the
second loafer. "Don't waste time thinking abart
it." Smithers removed his silk hat and frock-coat.</p>

<p>"That's couridge! That's a man!" screamed the
emotional nursemaid.</p>

<p>That settled it. With a stentorian cry of "Stand
back, there!" to the two fat-headed children&mdash;a cry
which was not needed, but inserted by way of trimming&mdash;Smithers
jumped feet foremost. There was
a mighty splash. When it subsided, Smithers was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
observed standing in the pond, the water reaching
up to the terminals of his string-mended braces.</p>

<p>The two children rolled over and over on the grass
in fits of inextinguishable laughter. It was a good
afternoon; they had had nothing quite so good since
the pantomime.</p>

<p>"Don't wait for her to come up," roared the second
loafer. "Dive. That's what you've got to do."</p>

<p>"I know what to do all right," replied Smithers,
who, as a matter of fact, didn't. He took one step
forward, and incontinently vanished down a fifteen-foot
hole, of the existence of which, though he had
fished that pond, he had previously been unaware.</p>

<p>As he was going down the hole he met Emily
Trimmins coming up. She paused and soldered
herself firmly on to as much of Smithers as she could
reach. He trod water very fast and very furiously,
like a child stamping its feet on the nursery floor
because it mayn't begin tea cake first. He lashed
out hard and indiscriminately with both hands,
and might have succeeded in scraping off most of the
half-drowned lady, but that he found in his struggles
they had both become entangled and tied together
by a rope. He could remember no prayer but the
grace after meat, which he repeated to himself fervently.
Then he gave up. His breath exploded into
the green jelly. He gave one more kick, and lost his
interest in things.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meantime the policeman, assisted by the
loafers, was pulling hard at the other end of the rope,
and brought to bank a job lot of mixed scarecrows.
Those being sorted out on the grass proved to be one
moiety Smithers and one moiety Trimmins. The
treatment of the apparently drowned was then proceeded
with energetically, to the great satisfaction
of a considerable number of spectators. They had
gathered in a moment.</p>

<p>Smithers came to himself, feeling ill but magnificent,
and assured the policeman that he was all
right. He was not much to look at at the moment,
yet everywhere he felt the admiring gaze upon him.
"Bravo!" exclaimed an old gentleman. A very
chorus of bravos followed, in which the policeman and
the doctor, who was busy with Emily Trimmins, joined
enthusiastically. Oh, it was good. It was very joyous.</p>

<p>"You done splendid, sir," said the policeman;
"the way you just managed to grab the end of the
rope as you went down the hole to fetch her up was
very smart. You must be pretty quick and neat with
your hands, and pretty cool and collected too, for
I daresay she give a lot of trouble when you got 'er."</p>

<p>"Well, you see," said Smithers, indulgently,
"she'd quite lost her head."</p>

<p>"And yet you managed to get the rope under her
armpits, tied a good knot, and wound the slack twice
round yourself! And it couldn't have been done<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
quicker if you had been on dry land, instead of under
water and 'ampered by the woman."</p>

<p>Emily Trimmins was by this time so far recovered
as to be ripe for removal in a four-wheeler, with a
policeman on the box. She did not look pretty.
Her hair had come down, and something had happened
to her nose. It was suggested that she had
struck it in entering the water. Alfred Smithers
remembered at an early stage of the struggle he had
kicked something; it was not worth mentioning. He
took, under advice, another drop of the brandy, and
was driven home. The crowd cheered.</p>

<p>Mrs Smithers was a woman of some energy.
Smithers was wrapped in hot blankets and tucked
away in bed in no time. He had a hot-water bottle
at his feet, and steaming rum-and-water at his head.
Mrs Smithers sent a polite note to Messrs Garson &amp;
Begg to say why her husband would be unable to be
at work as usual on the following day. She threw
the story over the right-hand wall of the back-yard
to Mrs Warboys, and over the left-hand wall to the
widow of the late Charles Push. In twenty minutes
the story was all over the terrace and had not shrunk.
There was great excitement, and three separate
houses hoped that Mrs Smithers would look in for a
cup of tea, and would be glad if they could do anything
to help. She accepted two of the invitations,
and would visit the third house on the morrow, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
would be obliged by the loan of a nutmeg, it being
necessary to keep up an internal glow after prolonged
struggle in cold water&mdash;the dare-devil had dived six
times before he found the woman&mdash;and the patient
otherwise being likely to take a chill in the vitals and
die hurriedly. Then she decided to have the newspaper
cuttings framed. The medal would go on the
mantelpiece, under glass.</p>

<p>Smithers lay upstairs, with the feeling that his
head was a large lump of dough traversed by a steam-propelled
roller, but satisfied that heroism and hot
rum were both excellent. He was soon asleep.</p>

<p>Glory reached its flood on the following day. An
offering was brought from the mother of Emily
Trimmins&mdash;a box encrusted without with small shells
and two pieces of looking-glass and lined with pink
satin within. The slip of paper which accompanied it
was inscribed&mdash;"A mother's tribute to her daughter's
presserver" (<i>sic</i>). The newspapers on the whole
did well, though the <i>Times</i> was quite outclassed in
the race for news, having but two lines to the half
column of the local organ. The magistrate cautioned
Miss Trimmins with some severity, and handed her
over to the care of her mother. He said that the
loafers were not men. He referred to the intrepid
courage, cool head, strength wedded with skill, of
Alfred Smithers&mdash;one of the men of whom England
had good cause to be proud.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>In the course of a week the postman had explained
away the other lady and was <i>au mieux</i> with Emily
Trimmins, who, so far as this story is concerned, may
now take a seat at the back.</p>

<p>A considerable number of Smithers' friends were
waiting, when the magistrate had finished, to have
the pleasure of shaking hands with Smithers, and
congratulating him, and so on.</p>

<p>And that night one of the men of whom England
had good cause to be proud went home most painfully
and uncompromisingly drunk.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Alfred Smithers, as he made his modest breakfast
of a cup of tea and two liver pills next morning,
explained to his wife that it had not been the drink
so much as the reaction.</p>

<p>She said that he needn't have taken the reaction.
She should overlook it this time and say no more,
knowing what he was when not misled. But
no amount of ironing would make that hat look
anything again. He went to work feeling that the
glory had been turned a little lower.</p>

<p>There were more newspaper cuttings, and later
there was something on vellum. Smithers said rather
bitterly that the Society seemed to do things on the
cheap. A medal came at last, presented by the vicar on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
behalf of a few friends and local inhabitants. It was
of silver and very large. It was kept on the mantelpiece
and shown to everybody who would look at it.</p>

<p>But the excitement was dying down. Glory was
on the ebb. Mrs Smithers would sometimes allow
two days to pass without alluding to the act of
heroism. Smithers watched the ebbing of the tide
with inward rage and with many vain efforts to stay
it. The neighbourhood sickened slowly of conversations
on the different ways of rescuing the drowning&mdash;conversations
initiated by Smithers in order to lead
to the case of the poor girl, Emily Trimmins. But
he had eaten praise-poison, and no other diet was rich
enough for him now. The neighbourhood wearying
of him and hinting as much, he would slip the medal
into his pocket on Saturday afternoons, get on his
bicycle, and seek fresh fields. A little group and a
bar-parlour sufficed. Whatever the group was discussing
when Smithers first leaned his bicycle against
the horse-trough outside, five minutes later they were
listening while Smithers got in with "I remember
once being on the Heath when some fool of a girl
jumped into twenty feet of water. What did I do?
Watched for the bubbles coming up and then dived.
The devil of it was that there was a strong cross-current
and&mdash;" etc. Later, the medal would be
produced. Poor Alfred Smithers! Nature's low
comedian, and yet smitten with a raging madness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
for the strut, the soliloquy, the limelight, the sympathetic
music, the roar of applause!</p>

<p>In his new part of hero he invented business that
was not good. He began to be, as he phrased it,
"master in his own house." He interfered in matters
which were the special province of Mrs Smithers.
He gave detailed instructions in domestic subjects of
which he was completely ignorant, and brought upon
himself ridicule. He was rude to Mrs Smithers, and
said that she needed to be driven with a firm hand.
He told the eight-pound general that his word was
law, and she forthwith gave notice on the ground that
she could put up with anything except haughtiness.</p>

<p>Mrs Smithers told him with some frankness that
she was glad to see his back when he went to business
of a morning, for he was more nuisance in a house
than a cartload of monkeys.</p>

<p>At business he had got, as a rule, just enough sense
not to try any heroism. He was a good book-keeper
and he had got a good place and he knew it. One
day, however, as his mind strayed for a moment to
high things, he made a small blunder affecting a large
sum, and the sum got on to the wrong side of the book
and caused trouble. In due course Mr Peter Begg
said, "Send me Smithers." The clerk who took the
message said to Smithers, "You're going to get
beans." And at this all the heroism in Smithers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
arose and boiled over, and he spluttered out that he
thought it would be rather the other way.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Mr Begg, "how do you come to
make such an infernal fool of yourself as this,
Smithers?" Smithers was now well alight.</p>

<p>"Kindly understand once for all that there are some
expressions I don't permit to be used to me by any
man."</p>

<p>Mr Begg gazed at Smithers pensively through his
eye-glass and sighed. "Get out," he said, "I'll
finish with you to-morrow morning. You may be
sober by then. Get out, go on!"</p>

<p>Smithers got out, and a slight chill fell on him.
Possibly he had gone too far. He was unusually
civil to his wife at supper that night, and appeared
somewhat preoccupied. After supper he asked his
wife what she thought of Klondike.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't care to have much to do with it.
Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, I had a few words with Begg to-day&mdash;Peter
Begg, the old one. I was in the right, as it happened,
but something I said seemed to sting him rather. I
can't say how it will end. I've as good as promised
to see him again to-morrow morning, but he may
not meet my views. And you know how it is when
either the senior partner's got to go or the book-keeper."</p>

<p>"You apologise and ask to be took on again," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Mrs Smithers, going right through the elegancies of
her husband's version and getting straight down
to the bedrock facts. "That's what you'll do if
you're not silly. You don't want to lose a good
place."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Smithers, with an air of
melancholy, "same old drudgery day after day, and
what's it all to come to? Nothing. I might strike
it if we went to Klondike."</p>

<p>"You aren't going to no Klondike," said Mrs
Smithers.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure it wouldn't be the right life for me.
I'm naturally a man of action. I do the book-keeping
well enough, but adventures and emergencies are
more my line. You remember what the magistrate
said when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I remember how drunk you were that night."</p>

<p>"Little you know!" said Smithers, though conscious
that the retort was somewhat vague. After
some meditation he managed to supplement it as
follows: "And little you care either&mdash;top button's
been off my wescut for the last four days."</p>

<p>"You've got a tongue in your head to ask with,
haven't you? Give it here and don't grumble."</p>

<p>And a little later Alfred Smithers, with a distinct
chill on the heroism, went up to bed.</p>

<p>The chill was even more distinct when in the
small hours of the morning Mrs Smithers shook<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
him by the shoulder, awoke him, told him that
there was a burglar in the kitchen, and asked him
to go down.</p>

<p>In the small hours of the morning one's vitality is
low.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>They had been unable to get any satisfactory sleep
after the disturbance, and they breakfasted early.
Mrs Smithers looked amused; Alfred Smithers looked
conciliatory.</p>

<p>"I want you to understand how it was," he said
pleadingly.</p>

<p>"I understand it all right. And how my poor
sides do ache with laughing. 'Lock our door as
quietly as you can,' you says, 'and don't make a
sound,' you says, 'for,' you says, 'if he knows we've
discovered him he'll have the lives of both of us.'
Sounds funnier still when it's said over again by daylight.
Oh, my poor sides!"</p>

<p>And even then Alfred Smithers did not become
rebellious; on the contrary, in a mirthless and subservient
way he smiled.</p>

<p>"I'm quite willing to own I blundered in what
seems now rather a funny way. But it wasn't in the
way you think, my dear. My dear Agnes, it really
wasn't."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell your own story," said Mrs Smithers, with a
victor's easiness.</p>

<p>"I was awoke sudden," said Smithers. "I don't
suppose I was more than half awake, which accounts
for the error of judgment. I'm a man, and not a
machine. We all blunder at times. I own I made
a mistake, and I can afford to laugh at it." He
managed to jerk up another semblance of a smile.
"At first I said that what you'd heard was a rat, and
what you'd seen was a shadow. Then when you
made me look through the corner of the blind, and I
saw the end of the man's leg drawn inwardly through
the downstairs window, I, being half asleep, supposed
that it was a regular professional burglar. And
if it had been that, my advice would have been
correct. Professional burglars carry revolvers in
their 'ip-pockets, and they'll shoot anybody&mdash;policeman
or any man&mdash;to destroy evidence against them.
Very well. What good was I unarmed against an
armed burglar? Foolhardiness isn't courage. If
you knew life as I know it you'd realise that. You
didn't agree with my ideas, and, as I was half asleep,
I own you were right; you said&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs Smithers took up the story triumphantly.</p>

<p>"I said it was stuff and nonsense, and so it was.
Burglars don't come to a penny-farthing place like
this; and if they did, they wouldn't wake up the
house opening a window. Two drops of ile, a shove<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
with the knife, and a wad o' paper to deaden the
sound of the spring when it comes back."</p>

<p>Smithers recovered himself sufficiently to ask how
they put in the two drops of oil and the wad of
paper.</p>

<p>"How should I know, not being a burglar myself?
Anyhow, I was right. I said it was just some tramp
new to the business, and hungry for a supper, and
that he'd bolt as soon as he heard anybody moving.
And didn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Smithers, "he did. I was just thinking
of getting out of bed and following you down the
stairs. But he bolted as soon as he heard our door
open, and was out of the house before you were half-way
down. That's my point. It was an error of
judgment on my part, not a want of courage. It's a
mercy he'd no time to take much."</p>

<p>"Well, 'e'd got the cold beef out, and precious little
he'd have left of it. The bottle of beer he knocked
over and broke in his hurry. The only thing he
actually got away with was that&mdash;er&mdash;that medal."</p>

<p>At this point Mrs Smithers' face became dark and
inscrutable.</p>

<p>"That's a sad pity," she added; "we shall miss it
too, with that inscription, 'For Gallantry and Courage;
Presented by a Few Admirers of Alfred
Smithers.' But you'll inquire of the police, of course,
and as likely as not you'll get it back. I believe I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
right in saying you ought to have gone to the police
there and then."</p>

<p>"I believe you were," said Alfred, with alacrity.
"It's no good going now, for the medal's certain to
be in the melting-pot. Besides, I've no fancy for
having the police in, interfering with my private
business. And I think it would be just as well if we
neither of us said a word about it."</p>

<p>"Oh, I must tell Mrs Warboys," said Mrs Smithers.
"I wouldn't miss seeing her laugh over that story
were it ever so. As for pore Mrs Push, when I come
to the part when I put your boots on my feet because
yours squeaked louder, and you'd got your head under
the bed-clothes, and I said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, look here," said Alfred, desperately, "I do
wish you wouldn't. I'd really much rather not. It
isn't often I ask for anything particular, but if that
story's told it's almost certain to be taken up in the
wrong way as far as it concerns me. I've made a
blunder and I've lost my medal. Ain't that enough
for you?"</p>

<p>"Then you've given up that Klondike idea," observed
Mrs Smithers, with more consecutiveness than
was immediately apparent.</p>

<p>"Certainly; oh, certainly! It was just a wandering
notion that wouldn't stand thinking over. And
I shall smooth old Peter Begg down all right. There
will be a little give-and-take compromise on both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
sides. It only wants tactful handling. Garson &amp;
Begg have been very good friends to me, and I'm not
going to throw them over. I couldn't do it, even if
you asked it."</p>

<p>"I don't ask it," said Mrs Smithers, drily.
"Get that fixed right by to-night and I won't
say nothing."</p>

<p>On his way to the City he reflected that it would
indeed require tact. However, he entered Mr Begg's
room and did his best.</p>

<p>"I've come," he said, "to apologise, sir, very
humbly for the way I spoke yesterday. As you saw,
I wasn't myself, sir."</p>

<p>"Then you <i>were</i> drunk?" said Mr Begg with mild
interest.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir. At least it was more drugged. I'd
suffered torments all day with toothache, and took
a little laudanum for it, and that made me come over
all anyhow. If I'd been myself I'd sooner have cut
off my right hand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That'll do," said Mr Begg. "No more need be
said about it in that case. But when you are troubled
with toothache again I should advise you either to
take a little less laudanum <i>or to take a good deal more</i>.
Now get on with your work."</p>

<p>Thus tact triumphed.</p>

<p>Mrs Smithers kept her word, and Mrs Warboys and
the relict of the late Charles Push have missed a story<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
which would undoubtedly have amused them.
Smithers has returned to his natural <i>r&ocirc;le</i>. The newspaper
cuttings have been replaced by a chromo which
happened to fit the frame exactly, and the happiness
is general.</p>

<h2>SOME NOTES ON CYRUS VERD</h2>


<p>The name of Cyrus Verd, once so frequently seen
in the newspapers and heard in conversation,
has now for many years past been rarely mentioned.
The absolute retirement of the latter part of his life
helped the public&mdash;always ready to forget&mdash;to forget
him. A few weeks ago at the club I happened to say
something or other about him, and a man who, as a
rule, knows his world turned to me and asked who
Cyrus Verd was. The obituary notice of him in the
<i>Times</i> the other day may possibly have revived
interest in what was really rather an extraordinary
personality. But the notice was brief, and beyond
names and dates said little more than that he was
"an eccentric millionaire, who, at the age of forty-five,
chose to surrender almost the whole of his
wealth and live a life of comparative poverty. It is
said that this step was the result of some curious religious
convictions, but Cyrus Verd himself never in
his lifetime offered any explanation of it."</p>

<p>The few notes which I propose to add, including as
they do a personal reminiscence of the man, may
possibly be of interest. A writer of fiction constantly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
arranges his problem to suit his solution of it; it is
perhaps beneficial, though somewhat humiliating, that
he should occasionally turn his attention to the problems
that real life sets him, and see how much more
difficult it is to find the solution then.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Cyrus Verd came to England in his thirty-fourth
year, an age at which many men are only at the commencement
of their career. He had already made
his fortune. I cannot say exactly how rich he was.
Many newspaper paragraphs at the time gave estimates
of his annual income&mdash;all different. I should
say that the only man who really knew was Cyrus
Verd himself. He owned steamships, railways,
factories, mines, and enough land for a small nation.
On his arrival in London many stories were told of his
extravagance and eccentricity.</p>

<p>He was debating where he should reside, and a
friend suggested that he should take or build a house
in Park Lane.</p>

<p>"Where is Park Lane?" asked Cyrus Verd. He
had been only two days in London.</p>

<p>"Runs along the east side of Hyde Park, in the
most fashionable quarter. Your coachman would
know it."</p>

<p>Verd went to look at it, and returned.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "it would be a fair site for a house&mdash;one
house. But there seems to be some brick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
tenements there of some sort or other already. I
suppose I could get those cleared away?"</p>

<p>He made the attempt, and was very angry at first
when he found that he could not "get those cleared
away." But he soon grew more philosophical.</p>

<p>"Your people," he observed, "cling to their little
homes, I guess."</p>

<p>He was always much disappointed at first if he
found there was anything which he could not buy.
He went over the National Gallery alone one morning;
he was a judge of pictures, and occasionally he put a
pencil cross on his catalogue. When he got downstairs
again he said to the man who handed him his
umbrella:</p>

<p>"My name's Cyrus Verd, and I'm at the M&eacute;tropole.
Write that down. Send me round the things I've
marked on my list and my secretary will hand you
the cheque."</p>

<p>This story was much exaggerated in the newspapers;
it was said that he had offered to buy the
entire National Gallery, building and all, as it stood.
I cannot say whether or not there was any truth in
the report which appeared about the same time, to
the effect that he had endeavoured to buy the Crown
jewels; but, as far as I can judge his character, it does
not seem impossible.</p>

<p>At the same time it would be rash to attempt to
judge his character only from such reports as these.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
The secretary of a well-known charitable institution
made that mistake. He wrote to ask for a donation
to the institution, and guaranteed that it should
be acknowledged by public advertisement in four of
the leading dailies. Cyrus Verd wrote back that he
had much pleasure in accepting the offer, and enclosed
fourpence in stamps. The acknowledgment appeared
as promised, and once more made Cyrus Verd a
common topic of conversation.</p>

<p>But one of the strangest things that he did never
got into the newspapers at all. He left, intentionally,
ten pounds in gold on the seat of a railway carriage.
On the following day he inquired at the Lost
Property Office if the money had been brought back.
He was told, with a smile, that it had not been
brought back, and that there was no earthly probability
that it ever would be. He repeated the experiment,
and again failed to recover the money. He
repeated it twenty times on different lines, and at
last a carriage-cleaner found the money and brought
it back. Cyrus Verd took the name and address of
that carriage-cleaner, made inquiries about him and
then sent for him.</p>

<p>"I don't see why I should reward you at all. It's
the company's business. You're their servant, and
such actions as yours increase the feelings of security
and confidence in their passengers. Are you suited
to a better position than you've got?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I am," said the man, "I'm a steady man,
and I've a talent for figures. I'm known for it among
my mates."</p>

<p>"Call on the chairman of directors&mdash;here is his
private address&mdash;give him my card, explain the circumstances,
and tell him from me that he is to put
you in a position of trust, with at least three times
your present wages."</p>

<p>The man came back to say that the chairman had
laughed at him&mdash;had said that he was not the man
to whom the application should have been made, and
that there was no chance of its being entertained in
any case.</p>

<p>"I must go and see him myself then," said Cyrus
Verd.</p>

<p>The chairman was not in a very good temper.</p>

<p>"Really, Mr Verd, you'll be asking me to carry
your luggage next. It's no part of my duties as
chairman of the directors to undertake business of
this kind. What that man ought to have done&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He did what I told him. You can get this put
through if you like. Will you?"</p>

<p>"Frankly, I won't. It creates a precedent.
It&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One moment, sir. If you'll have a copy of Bradshaw
brought in here I'll show you something."</p>

<p>Now, the chairman knew that Cyrus Verd was
eccentric, and so he was not surprised. He did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
respect eccentricity. But he respected capital; and
he knew that Cyrus Verd had already&mdash;thanks to his
capital&mdash;had some little games with railway companies.
So he rang the bell, and a Bradshaw was
brought.</p>

<p>When the servant had gone Verd drew a penny
blue chalk-pencil from his pocket. He opened the
Bradshaw, unfolded the map, and, without saying a
word, made certain marks upon it.</p>

<p>The chairman watched him closely, and his face
changed. "Who's going to do it?" he gasped.
Then he repented, as a man does repent when he has
given himself away. "Parliament?" he said.</p>

<p>"That's all right," remarked Cyrus Verd, replacing
his blue pencil. "I've asked. They daren't block it."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't pay," the chairman said, with an
effort at the careless smile.</p>

<p>"That matters only to the man who runs it.
Either way it would wreck your line&mdash;and you. As
my time here is short, don't pretend that it wouldn't,
because, of course, I know that you know that it
would."</p>

<p>"Am I to understand," said the chairman, angrily,
"that you come here to threaten me with this new
line?"</p>

<p>"Well, I was talking about a carriage-cleaner. I
want him rewarded. I want it done right away.
When I want anything done I don't tell myself that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
I won't spend more than a couple of millions on
getting it done."</p>

<p>"Men like you ought not to be allowed to live. I
tell you that plainly, Mr Verd."</p>

<p>"There are no men like me. Good-afternoon, then."</p>

<p>"Oh, wait, wait! The man deserves to be rewarded,
only these things must be done in the regular
way. If he will write to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm going to no underlings," said Cyrus Verd,
"and I'm in a hurry. Next time I mark that map,
<i>those marks will stop there</i>!"</p>

<p>The chairman seemed suddenly to recollect something.
"What was this about a carriage-cleaner?
Oh, yes, it's irregular; but naturally you wouldn't
understand. I'll see about it myself."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Within six weeks."</p>

<p>"Days?"</p>

<p>"Weeks."</p>

<p>"Then it shan't be days. It shall be within six
hours&mdash;a position of trust and three times his present
wages within six hours. The way you talk makes
me tired. If you know enough to come in when it
rains, I guess you'll drop this argument."</p>

<p>The chairman did drop it, and that same night the
carriage-cleaner received the official intimation of his
promotion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p><hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Cyrus Verd was young, fabulously wealthy, and
unmarried. He was a tall, broad-shouldered man.
He was not exactly handsome, but he had that look
of power which, in the eyes of women, does just as
well. When he first came over he was the hope of
many noble matrons with unmarried daughters. He
afterwards became their despair; and this was in consequence
of his marriage with Anna Fokes&mdash;a woman
who had neither wealth nor high position&mdash;she had
been a governess. She was remarkably beautiful,
but her beauty was somewhat discounted by the
fact that she had&mdash;or was said to have&mdash;a trace of
negro blood in her veins. When this marriage was
announced, a certain noble matron said a cruel thing
to Cyrus Verd. She congratulated him sardonically
on having no racial prejudices.</p>

<p>"I shall remember your kind words, countess," he
said pleasantly.</p>

<p>Within a year the countess was a ruined woman.
Evidence came to her husband's knowledge which
led him to divorce her. This terrible fall was closely
followed by the loss of a part of her private income.
She was left without a friend in the world and with
much reduced means&mdash;a disgraced woman. There
were some who said that Cyrus Verd had "remembered
those kind words"; but if he was responsible
for her exposure and ruin he was careful not to let
any evidence of his actions appear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>It was seven years after his marriage that, as the
<i>Times</i> obituary states, he gave up almost the whole
of his property. He prepared a long list of relations
and friends of himself and of his wife, and of certain
charitable and religious institutions in which they
were interested. He reserved for himself an annual
income of five hundred pounds only, which to a man
who had lived as a millionaire for years would be
abject poverty. The remainder was divided among
these relations, friends and institutions, and made
over to them by deed of gift. Of course, many
people said that he was mad. If he was, his wife was
mad also, for the step that he took was planned by
him with her, and she fully agreed to it.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Personally, I do not think he was mad. I had expected
him to take that step, and I think I could
produce evidence that in a private letter I actually
foretold it. For it happened by chance that I came
upon him when he was in the enjoyment of what he
called his annual holiday, and it was significant.</p>

<p>It was in an out-of-the-way Welsh village, one year
before his marriage. I was stopping there because it
was out of the way chiefly&mdash;I had some work to do.
Cyrus Verd was there in a caravan, and he was masquerading.
He was "H. Jackson, photographer,"
a travelling photographer in a very small way of
business, with show-cases of fly-blown photographs of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
posed rustics affixed to the outside of his caravan.
He wore a shabby serge suit, much stained with
chemicals, and a soft felt hat. He had not attempted
to disguise his face; he had never allowed any portrait
of himself to appear in any illustrated paper,
shop window, or public gallery, and probably considered
himself safe from recognition. But I had
once been in the same drawing-room with Cyrus Verd,
and he had been pointed out to me. He was not a
man who could easily be forgotten. I never had the
least doubt that the shabby man who stood touting
for custom outside that caravan was Cyrus Verd.</p>

<p>I allowed him to photograph me. I remember
that the price was seven shillings and sixpence for
a dozen, and that he bothered me to take two dozen
for fourteen shillings.</p>

<p>"No thanks, Mr Verd," I said.</p>

<p>He seemed to reflect for a moment, and then he
asked me how I knew. I told him where I met him.</p>

<p>"It's my only enjoyment," he said. "You won't
spoil it&mdash;everybody thinks I'm yachting."</p>

<p>"I won't spoil it," I said. "You might enjoy it
always if you cared so much about it."</p>

<p>"No, I couldn't. Thank you. I am obliged to you."</p>

<p>"All right," I said. "Good-morning," and I
moved off. He called me back again.</p>

<p>"You'll excuse me," he said, "but you've not paid
for those photographs."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>"You haven't printed them yet."</p>

<p>"My rule is that payment must be made at the
time of sitting."</p>

<p>"Well, I won't pay for a thing until I get it."</p>

<p>We squabbled about it, and finally came to a compromise.
Then rather abruptly he asked me to come
to supper with him that night.</p>

<p>"And I warn you," he said, "that I live solely on
what I make by this photographic business."</p>

<p>Of course I went. We had supper in the caravan.
It consisted of chops and potatoes, which Cyrus Verd
cooked. He cooked better than he photographed.
We drank beer, which Verd had fetched from the
public-house in a jug. He had no servant with him,
and did everything for himself. I jeered at him gently
all through supper.</p>

<p>"It's very pretty," I said, "but it is play-acting.
It's not genuine."</p>

<p>"It is absolutely genuine. I tell you that I love
simplicity. Had I my choice, I would always go on
like this, and I like the work too. In this little
village I've already picked up enough orders to keep
me busy for a week. Every year I have a month of
this, and I look forward to it as I look forward to
nothing else."</p>

<p>"What?" I said. "Do you think that this sort
of thing proves that you love simplicity? It proves
the absolute contrary&mdash;that you love variety. No<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
one is compelled to live the life of a rich man against
his will. If you live that life for eleven months in
the year, and the life of a poor man for one month,
you like to be rich eleven times as much as you like
to be poor."</p>

<p>"What you say," he said, "sounds plausible.
But you don't know the circumstances. I am sorry
I cannot offer you a cigar. 'H. Jackson, photographer,'
cannot afford to smoke cigars."</p>

<p>"I have my own case here," I said.</p>

<p>I selected a cigar, lit it, put the case back in my
pocket, and watched Cyrus Verd. The fragrance
reached him. He grew uneasy. He rose, and began
to put the supper things away in silence.</p>

<p>"Shall I help you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No!" he said snappishly. He held out for about
five minutes, and then said, "Give me one of those
cigars."</p>

<p>He opened the case with trembling hands, and took
no notice of my amusement at first. When his cigar
was lit, and the first sigh of satisfaction was over, he appeared
aggrieved, and asked me what I was laughing at.</p>

<p>"Go back and be a millionaire," I said. "You
dress this part well, and"&mdash;glancing round the
caravan&mdash;"it's very correctly staged; but you make
the feeblest H. Jackson, peripatetic photographer,
that ever disgraced the British drama."</p>

<p>"Listen," he said eagerly. "H. Jackson is a poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
man. As a rule he smokes cheap shag in a clay. A
gentleman comes along and offers him a cigar. H.
Jackson jumps at the treat, of course. Where's the
inconsistency?"</p>

<p>"I didn't offer you a cigar. You asked for it.
Cyrus Verd could do that, but H. Jackson could not."</p>

<p>"I've half a mind to pitch your beastly cigar out of
the window!"</p>

<p>But he did not. He smoked that, and others,
and talked delightfully. He had a fine sense of
humour, and was willing enough to laugh at himself
as a millionaire; but in the character of H. Jackson
he had an ardent belief in himself and a strong
desire to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>After that, for a week, we always spent the evenings
together. Gradually I guessed at the "circumstances"
to which he had alluded. Near to the
village was the country seat of a baronet, and Anna
Fokes was governess to his children, and Cyrus Verd
was in love with Anna Fokes. He had met her in
the same place a year before. She and I knew who
he really was; but no one else in the village did. Her
method of procedure was simple. On the arrival of
H. Jackson she took the baronet's children to be
photographed; afterwards she called every day to
see if the photographs were finished. He was, in
fact, engaged to her before the night on which I first
had supper with him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>A week after my return to town I got a note from
Cyrus Verd, asking me to dine with him and "assist
at the funeral of H. Jackson." I accepted. We
were alone, and the dinner was ridiculously magnificent.
I congratulated him on his engagement,
which that morning had been made public. He
seemed in the best of spirits. After dinner he said:</p>

<p>"I am going to explain the death of H. Jackson.
Money has power, and the novelty of possession is
attractive. But any other kind of power is better
worth while, and the novelty ceases."</p>

<p>"Also," I observed, "time flies, and one must not
judge by appearances."</p>

<p>"Yes, I quite understand what you would imply.
I am talking platitudes. I guess, if the platitude
happens to be the truth that doesn't matter. The
actual enjoyment to be obtained from money must
soon go, and can only be renewed in the enjoyment
of another. I marry a poor woman who has worked
in a subservient position; in her enjoyment I shall
enjoy again. Wealth, and the power it gives, will be so
new and attractive to her that I may safely calculate
on a fair period of very decent second-hand enjoyment;
consequently, H. Jackson may die."</p>

<p>"Wait," I said, "your wife's enjoyment will cease
in the end, and yours with it. What then?"</p>

<p>"Some women have a special gift for enjoying
wealth for ever," he said meditatively. "But you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
are right; Miss Fokes has not that gift. Then&mdash;then&mdash;there
will be a revival of H. Jackson, or something
very like it, perhaps in a less crude form."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>This practically ended my acquaintance with
Cyrus Verd. At first I still saw him occasionally,
but I could not afford to know millionaires, and told
him so. Afterwards, at the time when he renounced
his wealth, I was away from England.</p>

<p>I can see, of course, that a practised author might
make something of a character&mdash;a consistent whole&mdash;out
of Cyrus Verd. I only give notes of what came
to my knowledge, and confess that I have not the
imagination requisite to connect them, supplement
them, and give them that air of probability which is
always found in the best fiction, and so seldom in
real life.</p>

<h2>THE FOUR-FINGERED HAND</h2>


<p>Charles Yarrow held fours, but as he had
come up against Brackley's straight flush they
only did him harm, leading him to remark&mdash;by no
means for the first time&mdash;that it did not matter what
cards one held, but only when one held them. "I
get out here," he remarked, with resignation. No
one else seemed to care for further play. The
two other men left at once, and shortly afterwards
Yarrow and Brackley sauntered out of the club
together.</p>

<p>"The night's young," said Brackley; "if you're
doing nothing you may as well come round to
me."</p>

<p>"Thanks, I will. I'll talk, or smoke, or go so far
as to drink; but I don't play poker. It's not my
night."</p>

<p>"I didn't know," said Brackley, "that you had
any superstitions."</p>

<p>"Haven't. I've only noticed that, as a rule, my
luck goes in runs, and that a good run or a bad run
usually lasts the length of a night's play. There
is probably some simple reason for it, if I were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
enough of a mathematician to worry it out. In
luck as distinct from arithmetic I have no belief
at all."</p>

<p>"I wish you could bring me to that happy condition.
The hard-headed man of the world, without
a superstition or a belief of any kind, has the best
time of it."</p>

<p>They reached Brackley's chambers, lit pipes, and
mixed drinks. Yarrow stretched himself in a lounge
chair, and took up the subject again, speaking lazily
and meditatively. He was a man of thirty-eight,
with a clean-shaven face; he looked, as indeed he
was, travelled and experienced.</p>

<p>"I don't read any books," he remarked, "but I've
been twice round the world, and am just about to
leave England again. I've been alive for thirty-eight
years, and during most of them I have been
living. Consequently, I've formed opinions, and one
of my opinions is that it is better to dispense with
superfluous luggage. Prejudices, superstitions, beliefs
of any kind that are not capable of easy and
immediate proof are superfluous luggage; one goes
more easily without them. You implied just now
that you had a certain amount of this superfluous
luggage, Brackley. What form does it take? Do
you turn your chair?&mdash;are you afraid of thirteen at
dinner?"</p>

<p>"No, nothing of that sort. I'll tell you about it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
You've heard of my grandfather&mdash;who made the
money?"</p>

<p>"Heard of him? Had him rubbed into me in my
childhood. He's in Smiles or one of those books,
isn't he? Started life as a navvy, educated himself,
invented things, made a fortune, gave vast sums in
charity."</p>

<p>"That is the man. Well, he lived to be a fair age,
but he was dead before I was born. What I know of
him I know from my father, and some of it is not included
in those improving books for the young.
For instance, there is no mention in the printed
biography of his curious belief in the four-fingered
hand. His belief was that from time to time he saw
a phantom hand. Sometimes it appeared to him in
the daytime, and sometimes at night. It was a right
hand with the second finger missing. He always
regarded the appearance of the hand as a warning.
It meant, he supposed, that he was to stop
anything on which he was engaged; if he was
about to let a house, buy a horse, go a journey, or
whatever it was, he stopped if he saw the four-fingered
hand."</p>

<p>"Now, look here," said Yarrow, "we'll examine
this thing rationally. Can you quote one special
instance in which your grandfather saw this maimed
hand, broke off a particular project, and found himself
benefited?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. In telling my father about it he spoke quite
generally."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Yarrow, drily. "The people who
see these things do speak quite generally as a rule."</p>

<p>"But wait a moment. This vision of the four-fingered
hand appears to have been hereditary. My
father also saw it from time to time. And here I
can give you the special instances. Do you remember
the Crewe disaster some years ago? Well, my
father had intended to travel by the train that was
wrecked. Just as he was getting into the carriage
he saw the four-fingered hand. He at once got out
and postponed his journey until later in the day.
Another occasion was two months before the failure
of Varings'. My father banked there. As a rule he
kept a comparatively small balance at the bank, but
on this occasion he had just realised an investment,
and was about to place the result&mdash;six thousand
pounds&mdash;in the bank, pending re-investment. He
was on the point of sending off his confidential clerk
with the money, when once more he saw the four-fingered
hand. Now at that time Varings' was considered
to be as safe as a church. Possibly a few
people with special means of information may have
had some slight suspicion at the time, but my father
certainly had none. He had always banked with
Varings, as his father had done before him. However,
his faith in the warning hand was so great that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
instead of paying in the six thousand he withdrew
his balance that day. Is that good enough
for you?"</p>

<p>"Not entirely. Mind, I don't dispute your facts,
but I doubt if it requires the supernatural to explain
them. You say that the vision appears to be hereditary.
Does that mean that you yourself have ever
seen it?"</p>

<p>"I have seen it once."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"I saw it to-night." Brackley spoke like a man
suppressing some strong excitement. "It was just
as you got up from the card-table after losing on your
fours. I was on the point of urging you and the other
two men to go on playing. I saw the hand distinctly.
It seemed to be floating in the air about a couple of
yards away from me. It was a small white hand,
like a lady's hand, cut short off at the wrist. For a
second it moved slowly towards me, and then vanished.
Nothing would have induced me to go on
playing poker to-night."</p>

<p>"You are&mdash;excuse me for mentioning it&mdash;not in
the least degree under the influence of drink.
Further, you are by habit an almost absurdly temperate
man. I mention these things because they
have to be taken into consideration. They show
that you were not at any rate the victim of a common
and disreputable form of illusion. But what service<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
has the hand done you? We play a regular point at
the club. We are not the excited gamblers of fiction.
We don't increase the points, and we never play
after one in the morning. At the moment when the
hand appeared to you, how much had you won?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-five pounds&mdash;an exceptionally large
amount."</p>

<p>"Very well. You're a careful player. You play
best when your luck's worst. We stopped play at
half-past eleven. If we had gone on playing till one,
and your luck had been of the worst possible description
all the time, we will say that you might have lost
that twenty-five and twenty-five more. To me it is
inconceivable, but with the worst luck and the worst
play it is perhaps possible. Now then, do you mean
to tell me that the loss of twenty-five pounds is a
matter of such importance to a man with your income
as to require a supernatural intervention to prevent
you from losing it?"</p>

<p>"Of course it isn't."</p>

<p>"Well, then, the four-fingered hand has not accomplished
its mission. It has not saved you from anything.
It might even have been inconvenient. If
you had been playing with strangers and winning,
and they had wished to go on playing, you could hardly
have refused. Of course, it did not matter with us&mdash;we
play with you constantly, and can have our revenge
at any time. The four-fingered hand is proved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
in this instance to have been useless and inept.
Therefore, I am inclined to believe that the appearances
when it really did some good were coincidences.
Doubtless your grandfather and father and yourself
have seen the hand, but surely that may be due to
some slight hereditary defect in the seeing apparatus,
which, under certain conditions, say, of the light and
of your own health creates the illusion. The four-fingered
hand is natural and not supernatural, subjective
and not objective."</p>

<p>"It sounds plausible," remarked Brackley. He
got up, crossed the room, and began to open the
card-table. "Practical tests are always the most
satisfactory, and we can soon have a practical
test." As he put the candles on the table he started
a little and nearly dropped one of them. He
laughed drily. "I saw the four-fingered hand again
just then," he said. "But no matter&mdash;come&mdash;let
us play."</p>

<p>"Oh, the two game isn't funny enough."</p>

<p>"Then I'll fetch up Blake from downstairs; you
know him. He never goes to bed, and he plays the
game."</p>

<p>Blake, who was a youngish man, had chambers
downstairs. Brackley easily persuaded him to join
the party. It was decided that they should play for
exactly an hour. It was a poor game; the cards ran
low, and there was very little betting. At the end of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the hour Brackley had lost a sovereign, and Yarrow
had lost five pounds.</p>

<p>"I don't like to get up a winner, like this," said
Blake. "Let's go on."</p>

<p>But Yarrow was not to be persuaded. He said
that he was going off to bed. No allusion to the four-fingered
hand was made in speaking in the presence
of Blake, but Yarrow's smile of conscious superiority
had its meaning for Brackley. It meant that Yarrow
had overthrown a superstition, and was consequently
pleased with himself. After a few minutes' chat
Yarrow and Blake said good-night to Brackley, and
went downstairs together.</p>

<p>Just as they reached the ground-floor they heard,
from far up the staircase, a short cry, followed
a moment afterwards by the sound of a heavy
fall.</p>

<p>"What's that?" Blake exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I'm just going to see," said Yarrow, quietly.
"It seemed to me to come from Brackley's rooms.
Let's go up again."</p>

<p>They hurried up the staircase and knocked at
Brackley's door. There was no answer. The whole
place was absolutely silent. The door was ajar;
Yarrow pushed it open, and the two men went in.</p>

<p>The candles on the card-table were still burning.
At some distance from them, in a dark corner
of the room, lay Brackley, face downwards, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
one arm folded under him and the other stretched
wide.</p>

<p>Blake stood in the doorway. Yarrow went
quickly over to Brackley, and turned the body partially
over.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Blake, excitedly. "Is the
man ill? Has he fainted?"</p>

<p>"Run downstairs," said Yarrow, curtly. "Rouse
the porter and get a doctor at once."</p>

<p>The moment Blake had gone, Yarrow took a
candle from the card-table, and by the light of it
examined once more the body of the dead man. On
the throat there was the imprint of a hand&mdash;a right
hand with the second finger missing. The marks,
which were crimson at first, grew gradually fainter.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Some years afterwards, in Yarrow's presence, a
man happened to tell some story of a warning apparition
that he himself had investigated.</p>

<p>"And do you believe that?" Yarrow asked.</p>

<p>"The evidence that the apparition was seen&mdash;and
seen by more than one person&mdash;seems to me fairly
conclusive in this case."</p>

<p>"That is all very well. I will grant you the apparition
if you like. But why speak of it as a warning?
If such appearances take place, it still seems to
me absurd and disproportionate to suppose that they
do so in order to warn us, or help us, or hinder us, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
anything of the kind. They appear for their own
unfathomable reasons only. If they seem to forbid
one thing or command another, that also is for their
own purpose. I have an experience of my own
which would tend to show that."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE TOWER</h2>


<p>In the billiard-room of the Cabinet Club, shortly
after midnight, two men had just finished a game.
A third had been watching it from the lounge at the
end of the room. The winner put up his cue, slipped
on his coat, and with a brief "Good-night" passed
out of the room. He was tall, dark, clean-shaven
and foreign in appearance. It would not have been
easy to guess his nationality, but he did not look
English.</p>

<p>The loser, a fair-haired boy of twenty-five, came
over to the lounge and dropped down by the side of
the elderly man who had been watching the billiards.</p>

<p>"Silly game, ain't it, doctor?" he said cheerfully.
The doctor smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "Vyse is a bit too hot for you,
Bill."</p>

<p>"A bit too hot for anything," said the boy. "He
never takes any trouble; he never hesitates; he
never thinks; he never takes an easy shot when
there's a brilliant one to be pulled off. It's almost
uncanny."</p>

<p>"Ah," said the doctor, reflectively, "it's a queer
thing. You're the third man whom I have heard say
that about Vyse within the last week."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe he's quite all right&mdash;good sort of chap,
you know. He's frightfully clever too&mdash;speaks a lot
of beastly difficult Oriental languages&mdash;does well at
any game he takes up."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the doctor, "he is clever; and he is
also a fool."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? He's eccentric, of course.
Fancy his buying that rotten tower&mdash;a sweet place to
spend Christmas in all alone, I don't think."</p>

<p>"Why does he say he's going there?"</p>

<p>"Says he hates the conventional Christmas, and
wants to be out of it; says also that he wants to shoot
duck."</p>

<p>"That won't do," said the doctor. "He may hate
the conventional Christmas. He may, and he probably
will, shoot duck. But that's not his reason for
going there."</p>

<p>"Then what is it?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"Nothing that would interest you much, Bill.
Vyse is one of the chaps that want to know too much.
He's playing about in a way that every medical man
knows to be a rotten, dangerous way. Mind, he may
get at something; if the stories are true he has already
got at a good deal. I believe it is possible for a
man to develop in himself certain powers at a certain
price."</p>

<p>"What's the price?"</p>

<p>"Insanity, as often as not. Here, let's talk about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
something pleasanter. Where are you yourself going
this Christmas, by the way?"</p>

<p>"My sister has taken compassion upon this lone
bachelor. And you?"</p>

<p>"I shall be out of England," said the doctor.
"Cairo, probably."</p>

<p>The two men passed out into the hall of the
club.</p>

<p>"Has Mr Vyse gone yet?" the boy asked the
porter.</p>

<p>"Not yet, Sir William. Mr Vyse is changing in
one of the dressing-rooms. His car is outside."</p>

<p>The two men passed the car in the street, and
noticed the luggage in the tonneau. The driver, in
his long leather coat, stood motionless beside it, waiting
for his master. The powerful headlight raked
the dusk of the street; you could see the paint on a
tired woman's cheek as she passed through it on her
way home at last.</p>

<p>"See his game?" said Bill.</p>

<p>"Of course," said the doctor. "He's off to the
marshes and that blessed tower of his to-night."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't envy him&mdash;holy sort of amusement
it must be driving all that way on a cold night
like this. I wonder if the beggar ever goes to sleep
at all?"</p>

<p>They had reached Bill's chambers in Jermyn Street.</p>

<p>"You must come in and have a drink," said Bill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't think so, thanks," said the doctor; "it's
late, you know."</p>

<p>"You'd better," said Bill, and the doctor followed
him in.</p>

<p>A letter and a telegram were lying on the table in
the diminutive hall. The letter had been sent by
messenger, and was addressed to Sir William Orlsey,
Bart., in a remarkably small hand-writing. Bill
picked it up, and thrust it into his pocket at once, unopened.
He took the telegram with him into the
room where the drinks had been put out, and opened
it as he sipped his whisky-and-soda.</p>

<p>"Great Scot!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Nothing serious, I hope," said the
doctor.</p>

<p>"I hope not. I suppose all children have got to
have the measles some time or another; but it's a bit
unlucky that my sister's three should all go down with
it just now. That does for her house-party at Christmas,
of course."</p>

<p>A few minutes later, when the doctor had gone,
Bill took the letter from his pocket and tore it open.
A cheque fell from the envelope and fluttered to the
ground. The letter ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Bill</span>,&mdash;I could not talk to you to-night, as
the doctor, who happens to disapprove of me, was in
the billiard-room. Of course, I can let you have the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
hundred you want, and enclose it herewith with the
utmost pleasure. The time you mention for repayment
would suit me all right, and so would any other
time. Suit your own convenience entirely.</p>

<p>"I have a favour to ask of you. I know you are
intending to go down to the Leylands' for Christmas.
I think you will be prevented from doing so. If that
is the case, and you have no better engagement,
would you hold yourself at my disposal for a week?
It is just possible that I may want a man like you
pretty badly. There ought to be plenty of duck this
weather, but I don't know that I can offer any other
attraction.&mdash;Very sincerely yours,</p>

<p style='text-align:right'>
"<span class="smcap">Edward Vyse.</span>"<br />
</p></div>

<p>Bill picked up the cheque, and thrust it into the
drawer with a feeling of relief. It was a queer invitation,
he thought&mdash;funnily worded, with the usual
intimations of time and place missing. He switched
off the electric lights and went into his bedroom. As
he was undressing a thought struck him suddenly.</p>

<p>"How the deuce," he said aloud, "did he know
that I should be prevented from going to Polly's
place?" Then he looked round quickly. He
thought that he had heard a faint laugh just behind
him. No one was there, and Bill's nerves
were good enough. In twenty minutes he was fast
asleep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The cottage, built of grey stone, stood some thirty
yards back from the road, from which it was screened
by a shrubbery. It was an ordinary eight-roomed
cottage, and it did well enough for Vyse and his servants
and one guest&mdash;if Vyse happened to want a
guest. There was a pleasant little walled garden of a
couple of acres behind the cottage. Through a doorway
in the further wall one passed into a stunted and
dismal plantation, and in the middle of this rose the
tower, far higher than any of the trees that surrounded
it.</p>

<p>Sir William Orlsey had arrived just in time to
change before dinner. Talk at dinner had been of
indifferent subjects&mdash;the queer characters of the
village and the chances of sport on the morrow. Bill
had mentioned the tower, and his host had hastened
to talk of other things. But now that dinner was
over, and the man who had waited on them had
left the room, Vyse of his own accord returned to
the subject.</p>

<p>"Danvers is a superstitious ass," he observed,
"and he's in quite enough of a funk about that tower
as it is; that's why I wouldn't give you the story of it
while he was in the room. According to the village
tradition, a witch was burned on the site where the
tower now stands, and she declared that where she
burned the devil should have his house. The lord of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
the manor at that time, hearing what the old lady
had said, and wishing to discourage house-building
on that particular site, had it covered with a plantation,
and made it a condition of his will that this
plantation should be kept up."</p>

<p>Bill lit a large cigar. "Looks like checkmate," he
said. "However, seeing that the tower is actually
there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quite so. This man's son came no end of a
cropper, and the property changed hands several
times. It was divided and sub-divided. I, for instance,
only own about twenty acres of it. Presently
there came along a scientific old gentleman and
bought the piece that I now have. Whether he knew
of the story, or whether he didn't, I cannot say, but
he set to work to build the tower that is now standing
in the middle of the plantation. He may have intended
it as an observatory. He got the stone for it
on the spot from his own quarry, but he had to import
his labour, as the people in these parts didn't think
the work healthy. Then one fine morning before
the tower was finished they found the old gentleman
at the bottom of his quarry with his neck
broken."</p>

<p>"So," said Bill, "they say of course that the
tower is haunted. What is it that they think
they see?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. You can't see it. But there are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
people who think they have touched it and have
heard it."</p>

<p>"Rot, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know exactly. You see, I happen to be
one of those people."</p>

<p>"Then, if you think so, there's something in it.
This is interesting. I say, can't we go across there
now?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, if you like. Sure you won't have any
more wine? Come along, then."</p>

<p>The two men slipped on their coats and caps.
Vyse carried a lighted stable-lantern. It was a
frosty moonlit night, and the path was crisp and hard
beneath their feet. As Vyse slid back the bolts of the
gate in the garden wall, Bill said suddenly, "By the
way, Vyse, how did you know that I shouldn't be at
the Leylands' this Christmas? I told you I was going
there."</p>

<p>"I don't know. I had a feeling that you were
going to be with me. It might have been wrong.
Anyhow, I'm very glad you're here. You are just
exactly the man I want. We've only a few steps to
go now. This path is ours. That cart-track leads
away to the quarry where the scientific gentleman
took the short cut to further knowledge. And here
is the door of the tower."</p>

<p>They walked round the tower before entering.
The night was so still that, unconsciously, they spoke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
in lowered voices and trod as softly as possible. The
lock of the heavy door groaned and screeched as the
key turned. The light of the lantern fell now on the
white sand of the floor and on a broken spiral staircase
on the further side. Far up above one saw a
tangle of beams and the stars beyond them. Bill
heard Vyse saying that it was left like that after the
death in the quarry.</p>

<p>"It's a good solid bit of masonry," said Bill, "but
it ain't a cheerful spot exactly. And, by Jove! it
smells like a menagerie."</p>

<p>"It does," said Vyse, who was examining the sand
on the floor.</p>

<p>Bill also looked down at the prints in the sand.
"Some dog's been in here."</p>

<p>"No," said Vyse, thoughtfully. "Dogs won't
come in here, and you can't make them. Also, there
were no marks on the sand when I left the place and
locked the door this afternoon. Queer, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"But the thing's a blank impossibility. Unless,
of course, we are to suppose that&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not finish his sentence, and, if he had finished
it, it would not have been audible. A chorus of
grunting, growling and squealing broke out almost
from under his feet, and he sprang backwards. It
lasted for a few seconds, and then died slowly
away.</p>

<p>"Did you hear that?" Vyse asked quietly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should rather think so."</p>

<p>"Good; then it was not subjective. What was it?"</p>

<p>"Only one kind of beast makes that row. Pigs,
of course&mdash;a whole drove of them. It sounded as if
they were in here, close to us. But as they obviously
are not, they must be outside."</p>

<p>"But they are not outside," said Vyse. "Come
and see."</p>

<p>They hunted the plantation through and through
with no result, and then locked the tower door and
went back to the cottage. Bill said very little. He
was not capable of much self-analysis, but he was
conscious of a sudden dislike of Vyse. He
was angry that he had ever put himself under an
obligation to this man. He had wanted the money
for a gambling debt, and he had already repaid it.
Now he saw Vyse in the light of a man with whom
one should have no dealings, and the last man from
whom one should accept a kindness. The strange
experience that he had just been through filled him
with loathing far more than with fear or wonder.
There was something unclean and diabolical about
the whole thing that made a decent man reluctant to
question or to investigate. The filthy smell of the
brutes seemed still to linger in his nostrils. He was
determined that on no account would he enter the
tower again, and that as soon as he could find a
decent excuse he would leave the place altogether.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>A little later, as he sat before the log fire and filled
his pipe, he turned to his host with a sudden question:
"I say, Vyse, why did you want me to come down
here? What's the meaning of it all?"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," said Vyse, "I wanted you for
the pleasure of your society. Now, don't get impatient.
I also wanted you because you are the most
normal man I know. Your confirmation of my experiences
in the tower is most valuable to me. Also,
you have good nerves, and, if you will forgive me for
saying so, no imagination. I may want help that
only a man with good nerves would be able to
give."</p>

<p>"Why don't you leave the thing alone? It's too
beastly."</p>

<p>Vyse laughed. "I'm afraid my hobby bores you.
We won't talk about it. After all, there's no reason
why you should help me?"</p>

<p>"Tell me just what it is that you wanted."</p>

<p>"I wanted you if you heard this whistle"&mdash;he took
an ordinary police-whistle down from the mantelpiece&mdash;"any
time to-night or to-morrow night, to
come over to the tower at once and bring a revolver
with you. The whistle would be a sign that I was in
a tight place&mdash;that my life, in fact, was in danger.
You see, we are dealing here with something preternatural,
but it is also something material; in addition
to other risks, one risks ordinary physical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
destruction. However, I could see that you were
repelled by the sight and the sound of these beasts,
whatever they may be; and I can tell you from my
own experience that the touch of them is even worse.
There is no reason why you should bother yourself
any further about the thing."</p>

<p>"You can take the whistle with you," said Bill.
"If I hear it I will come."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Vyse, and immediately changed
the subject. He did not say why he was spending
the night in the tower, or what it was he proposed
to do there.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was three in the morning when Bill was suddenly
startled out of his sleep. He heard the whistle
being blown repeatedly. He hurried on some clothes
and dashed down into the hall, where his lantern and
revolver lay all ready for him. He ran along the
garden path and through the door in the wall until
he got to the tower. The sound of the whistle had
ceased now, and everything was horribly still. The
door of the tower stood wide open, and without hesitation
Bill entered, holding his lantern high.</p>

<p>The tower was absolutely empty. Not a sound
was to be heard. Bill called Vyse by name twice
loudly, and then again the awful silence spread over
the place.</p>

<p>Then, as if guided by some unseen hand, he took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
the track that led to the quarry, well knowing what
he would find at the bottom of it.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The jury assigned the death of Vyse to an accident,
and said that the quarry should be fenced in. They
had no explanation to offer of the mutilation of the
face, as if by the teeth of some savage beast.</p>

<h2>THE FUTILITY OF WILLIAM PENARDEN</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"Let the great book of the world be your principal study."</p>
<p style='text-align:right'><span class="smcap">Chesterfield.</span><br />
</p></div>


<p>General Penarden, C.B., married late in
life, and had one son, who was intended by
General Penarden to follow his father's profession, to
be V.C., and D.S.O., and to be a bright and shining
light. As the intentions of destiny did not precisely
agree with the intentions of General Penarden, it is,
perhaps, just as well that the old man died when
William, his son, was a boy of six. He was thus
saved some disappointment.</p>

<p>But even in those brief years he was not saved all
disappointment. He made, grimly, a list of the
different things of which the child was frightened,
and it was a very long list. Many, of course, were
things of which any child is frightened; many others
came into a doubtful category; the fear would have
been excusable, perhaps, in a girl. There was left a
residue which was all wrong and quite inexplicable.
The General, though disappointed, did not despair.
He quoted instances of brave men who had had a
timid childhood. His optimistic programme was
that his son should have it all knocked out of him by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
the paternal hand, by the severe discipline of a public
school, and by experience of dangers. Familiarity
of them would breed contempt, and all would yet be
well. On the day before his death from apoplexy he
imagined to himself despatches in which his son's
name figured brilliantly.</p>

<p>The General had married a woman much younger
than himself. She was beautiful and she was bored.
She came of a decaying race. The brilliant vices and
wild extravagances of her eighteenth-century forefathers
had ended with the usual and prosaic sequel
of tainted blood and fallen fortunes. Possibly there
were few things that bored this tired London woman
more than her son William. She remembered to talk
about him a little to her friends; she had the best
possible care taken of him by the best possible
servants; she gave him expensive presents on the days
appointed. But she did not want to be with him very
much. When she was with him she either spoiled
him or bullied him, and more often she bullied him.
At the age of twelve, William, at a preparatory
school which he hated, was bidden to write an essay
on the subject of war. He wrote childishly, and with
many faults of punctuation and spelling, to the effect
that war was the wickedest thing in the world, and
that a soldier's profession was the most inhuman and
abominable. By chance the essay came into his
mother's way, and she laughed till she cried over it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
He was not a pretty boy, and he could never be admirable,
but there seemed to be some chance that he
might, at least, be quaint. At the age of fourteen he
made to his mother a profound observation, to wit,
that though for many long years past he himself had
been getting older and older, she had never changed
one little bit. For this she kissed him; he might
have found her in a mood when she would have
struck him for it.</p>

<p>It was quite clear by this time that he was not to
be a soldier. The weakness of his physique supported
the firmness of his wishes in this respect. He could
have never passed the doctor. At his public school,
which he hated even more than the preparatory
school, medical certificates freed him to some extent
from compulsory games. He was a muff at all games,
and he was no great scholar; yet he was less unpopular
at school than might have been expected. He had no
pretensions whatever, and he was very obliging. He
would do anything for anybody. He had the fatal gift
of imagination, and a few eccentricities that amused
other boys. Boys treat with good humour that with
which they are amused. There was, for instance, a
certain short cut, a footpath across some fields, in
common use by the boys, which William Penarden
resolutely refused to take. He gave no reasons, but
he said that he could not take that path. So he went
all the way round, and was frequently late, and from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
that came trouble. But he remained obstinate. It
was one of the things that pleased the other boys.
"Mad as a hatter," they would say, and quote his
dislike of the field-path in proof.</p>

<p>It was during his first term at Cambridge that he
heard from his mother that she intended to marry
again. She had not aged at all, except to the most
careful observer and to her own maid, and even her
own maid did not know everything. It was, perhaps,
rather remarkable that she had not re-married before,
but she had always preferred the admiration of the
many to the devotion of one, and, by the terms of the
late General's will, her re-marriage made her son
much richer and herself much poorer. It may have
occurred to her that this prolonged struggle with age
could not be carried on indefinitely. As for the
money, she was marrying a wealthy baronet, and
knew how to take care of herself. It was true that he
was a sportsman who hated London, and that she
would have to live for the most part in the country.
But the things which are supposed to amuse had
bored her so long that she had begun to wonder if she
could not be amused by the things that are supposed
to bore. Then there was always the resource of
foreign travel. She knew a doctor who could generally
be counted upon to order her to the place to
which she wished to go.</p>

<p>William was not much surprised by the news, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
he wrote the kindest of letters to his mother. He
was really an extremely kind young man. He had
already met many characters of doubtful probity.
None of them had ever asked him to lend money;
he had always anticipated them by the offer of a loan.
On the occasions when his mother got to hear of this
she had been unfailingly very, very mad with him.
At present, William was quite ready to accept the
situation, but the situation was not quite ready to
accept William. He was not much of a sportsman,
and his new father said candidly that he could see
nothing in the boy. Lady Quyne, formerly Mrs Penarden,
became suddenly serious and flagrantly moral
on the subject of William's career. She spelt career
with a capital letter in her letters to him; she pronounced
it in italics in her talk. It was true that it
was not necessary for him to make an income, but no
good ever came of idleness. She had, by the way,
made an exhaustive trial of it herself for the last
twenty years, and was, therefore, in a position to
speak. She suggested politics and the Diplomatic
Service; he had no taste for either. Above all, she
emphasised the bad effect which a prolonged homelife
had upon a young man. Before he took his
degree&mdash;it was a pass degree&mdash;he had learned to interpret
this correctly, and spent very little of his vacations
at home. He had made friends who found him
amiable and liked him to visit them occasionally.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Sometimes he travelled. When he was at home he
did not see very much of his mother. There were
always other visitors staying in the house. Sir
Charles Quyne was pessimistic on the subject of
William. "He can play the piano a bit," he said,
"and he can drive the car. And there is not one
other solitary damned thing that he can do. I wish
to goodness he would get married."</p>

<p>William did not get married, but he kept out of
the way, which, after all, was almost as good.
Further, to please his mother, he said that he proposed
ultimately to become a candidate for Parliament.
In the meantime, he would like to devote
two or three years to serious preparation. Lady
Quyne observed that he could cram up all that a
Member needed to know in two or three weeks, but
did not remonstrate further. William took a riverside
cottage and a small flat in London. He went
from one to the other as the mood took him, and as a
rule made the journey on his motor-car. He liked
driving the car, but it was rather a fearful pleasure.
He was, perhaps, the most cautious driver extant,
and the secret amusement of his hireling chauffeur.
When William went from his cottage to his flat in
town, he made the chauffeur take the wheel when they
approached London. William did not like driving
through thick traffic at any time, and did not like
driving by night at all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>One Saturday night in June, Dolling, the chauffeur,
received an unexpected visit from a long-absent
brother. The visitor arrived just at the moment
when he and his master were about to start for
London in the car. Timidity and amiability struggled
in the breast of William Penarden, and amiability
won.</p>

<p>"I shan't want you, Dolling," he said, "I can
manage it all right by myself."</p>

<p>Mr Dolling was sure that it was very kind of him.
It was a bright moonlight night, with deep, bothering
shadows.</p>

<p>William started slowly. He already felt nervous.
How would it be if he gave up the London idea altogether?
He could telegraph in the morning to the
friend whom he was to have met. He turned off
from the London road, where a circuit of two or three
miles would bring him back to his cottage again.
There was a dark stretch of road here, trees on either
side almost meeting overhead. Beyond, the road
lay white and open. William went into his third
speed as he emerged from the darkness. At that
moment a black figure shot out from the hedge into
the road right across the way of the car. In a moment
or two William had jammed on the brakes, and the
car stood still, with the engines racing. Had he
touched the man or not? It seemed to him to be a
long while before he could force himself to look round<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
and see. When he did so, he saw the black figure
lying motionless on the road in the bright moonlight.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?" William called hoarsely. All
was silent. With great care William turned his car
round in the road and crawled up alongside. He
could see now that it was the figure of a man, raggedly
dressed, absolutely motionless. The hat had fallen
off, and the moonlight made the thick, white hair
brilliant.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?" William asked again. He
stared hard to see if he could detect the slightest
movement. There was none. He listened intently,
stopping his engines. The whole night seemed to him
full of the silence of the dead.</p>

<p>He knew perfectly well what he ought to do, but
sheer panic had hold of him. He touched the switch
and his engines started again. For once in his life
he drove recklessly, and he drove to London. There
would be ample evidence that he had been intending
to go to London when he started, and there would be
no reason why he should ever have taken his car on
the road where the dead body would be found. No
one had seen him; no suspicion could attach to him.</p>

<p>Long before he reached London, the drunken
tramp, whom William supposed that he had killed,
sat up. The car had never touched him. He had
fallen in the road and had been slightly stunned. He
rubbed his aged and disreputable head and grumbled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
to himself that this was what came of those sanguinary
motors. Then he walked home, kicked his wife,
and slept the sleep of the just.</p>

<p>The price that William Penarden was to pay for
his cowardice was heavy enough. He was never to
know that he had not even touched the man. Coincidence
was already busy to convince him that he had
killed that man, and to keep the terror of it fresh in
his mind for the remaining two years of his life.</p>

<p>He came back from London by train on Sunday
afternoon. He told Dolling that he was ill, and that
he did not feel up to driving the car. Dolling could
fetch it back from the garage on Monday. Dolling
looked remarkably serious. He did not know if his
master had heard of it, but a terrible thing had happened
not three miles away from them. A man had
been found dead in the road on Saturday night, and
it was supposed that he had been knocked down by a
motor-car. It was not the London road; it was just
where&mdash;</p>

<p>William Penarden stopped him abruptly and
savagely. It was all true, then, and not the dream
that he had hoped to find it.</p>

<p>Yes, it was true enough, but it was another man
and another car. The hoary reprobate who had been
dazzled by the head-lights of Penarden's car, and had
stunned himself in his fall, was now no worse than he
usually was after his usual Saturday night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>For many weeks Penarden carefully avoided the
newspapers. He was afraid of what he would find
there. After that came a feeling of security, but
never a moment's peace. That brilliant white hair
in the moonlight wove itself into the fabric of his
dreams. That black figure lurched ever before his
car, till Penarden had a nervous breakdown and gave
up motoring. When he got a little better, the chief
question in his mind was how long he could stand it,
how long it would be before his mind gave way and
in his ravings he let loose his secret. Morose, nervous,
ill, he saw no one. For a long time he travelled.
Change of scene was an opiate. It put the day of
madness a little further off.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The poor man did his best. The political career
was now definitely given up. Lady Quyne spoke
with a sigh to the more intimate part of her circle
of her son's incurable idleness. On his return to
England he had yielded to arch&aelig;ology; it was a
subject which had always interested him, and he
looked to it now to take his mind off. He journeyed
from one cathedral city to another, asking erudite
questions, making rubbings of brasses, and always
haunted.</p>

<p>In the course of his wanderings in quest of the
quaint he stopped at a provincial town, the normal
serenity of which was in a state of temporary inter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>ruption
owing to some reliability trials of motors
being held in its neighbourhood. Penarden drove to
the hotel which the railway porter impressed upon
him was the only one likely to have accommodation
for such as himself, and asked for a room. The clerk
announced mournfully that "only No. 54 was unoccupied,
and&mdash;well&mdash;before offering it to the gentleman
he had better see the manager."</p>

<p>That official saw the class of man he was dealing
with, and regretted deeply that he had no other room.
But the reliability trials were on, and his resources
were strained to the uttermost. It was all that he
had to offer, and it was on the top floor of an annexe,
the decoration of which was not yet completed. The
painters' step-ladders and planks still lingered in the
corridor. The view from the window was obstructed
by a mean building scarcely eight feet away. True,
the mean building had been condemned and was to
come down; and the decorations would be finished
and the workmen would be out in a fortnight; but
in the meantime&mdash;</p>

<p>Well, in the meantime, William Penarden did not
care much in what room he failed to get to sleep, and
he accepted the bedroom that was offered. He even
managed to sleep in it, until in the early hours he was
aroused by the waiter (in dress trousers and the
jacket of his pyjamas), who told him that the building
opposite was well alight, and that they hoped that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
the annexe would not catch, the wind being favourable
to them, but that Mr Penarden had better get
down at once and bring his travelling bag with
him.</p>

<p>"Right," said Penarden, and sent the waiter to
wake up the others. Then he dressed quickly, and
looked out of his window down to the alley beneath.
The fire brigade had not yet arrived. Two policemen
were doing their best to keep the narrow alley
clear. An ugly old woman, in violent hysterics, was
screaming, "They're up there!" and a man was trying
to quiet her. Then Penarden gave a great sigh
of relief, for here was the chance of expiation. He
took the longest of the planks that the painters had
left and ran it through his own window so that it
dropped on a window-ledge of the burning house opposite.
As a rule, he had no head at all for heights,
but now he felt perfectly unperturbed. He did not
attempt to walk along the plank, for he was not
giving a circus exhibition, but he began to work himself
along it slowly in a sitting position, taking great
care not to jolt the end of it off the window-ledge
opposite. An authoritative voice below shouted to
him to go back. He went on. He reached the
window opposite and flung it open. A volley of black
and stifling smoke poured forth and he nearly fell.
Then he climbed into the room, and the last that was
seen of him was that he stood at the window, taking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
off his coat to put it over his head before he could go
further. He was not seen again alive.</p>

<p>And, as his mother, Lady Quyne, observed, it was
all so absolutely futile. The people in the house had
already got out, and he had let himself be guided by
the hysterical raving of some chance woman in the
crowd. So he annoyed her almost as much in death
as he had done in life. But it is possible that his
death, horrible though it was, was for him of an
extreme happiness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE PATHOS OF THE COMMONPLACE</h2>


<p>He was a middle-aged man when he first came to
the town. He had taken an appointment as
clerk to a firm of solicitors, and he was happy in that
appointment, regarding it as a step upwards. He
was small in stature and wild in manner. His eyes
had a hesitating look in them, and he pressed his thin
lips tightly together, as though to counterbalance his
look of hesitation and make himself appear rather
firm. He found himself furnished apartments in a
house that was one of a row on the very outskirts of
the great town. They were two rooms at the top of
the house, small and shabbily furnished, looking out
on a piece of waste land at the back. On this piece
of waste land there was one large tree growing. At
the time when he first took the rooms he was talkative
and told the landlady all about himself.</p>

<p>"My name is Peters. You see, I've just got a step
upwards rather, by being appointed clerk to Grantham
&amp; Flynders. Formerly, I used to keep the books
for Flynders's cousin, who's a grocer in a small way
at Melstowe&mdash;oh, quite a comparatively small way."</p>

<p>"Really now," said Mrs Marks, a good woman, but
not always logical; "and then for this Flynders to
give himself those airs&mdash;and his cousin no more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
that! Ah! I've many a time said that half the world
doesn't know who the other half's relations are!"</p>

<p>"So it is!" replied Peters. "I may say&mdash;I think
I may say&mdash;that I've done a good deal for Flynders's
cousin. He's taken my advice more than once, notably
in an extension of the counter-trade in effervescents
during the hot weather, and he's found it
pay him. Well, <i>he</i> knew that I could do a good deal
better than I was doing. I'd taught myself things,
you see. There was shorthand now. At Melstowe
my shorthand was, if it's not to use too strong a term,
going to rot, simply going to rot&mdash;in a grocery and
general, there's no use for it. I pointed that all out to
Flynders's cousin, and he&mdash;being good-natured and
seeing what I was&mdash;got me this berth with this Flynders
himself. So I left Melstowe, and I left Flynders's
cousin&mdash;left him, thanks to me, doing to my certain
knowledge some gross more in the lemonade than he
had ever done in the past." Peters paused, and
looked proud of himself. "Mind," he went on, rather
weakly, "I'm telling you all this not from any&mdash;any
desire to tell anyone anything, but because I
may be giving up these rooms in two or three years,
or even less. You see, I've taken one of those steps
upwards that may lead to anything. In a post like
mine you just work yourself up and work yourself
up. Starting with what I may call family influence,
and having rather a strong natural turn, I may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
made managing clerk in no time; then, perhaps,
Flynders dies, and I'm took in. 'Grantham &amp;
Peters' wouldn't sound bad. Only then, of course,
I shouldn't keep these rooms&mdash;I should be taking a
house of my own."</p>

<p>Mrs Marks considered this, not unjustly, to be a
little wild. But it was cheaper always to humour a
lodger; and she mostly chose the cheapest. "Then
you'd be getting married," she said.</p>

<p>"Under the circumstances I should ask Flynders's
cousin's second daughter to&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To consider it," suggested the landlady.</p>

<p>"To <i>re</i>-consider it," said Peters, sadly and correctively.
He had a nervous anxiety to get away
from the subject. He glanced out of the window.
"I call that a pleasant lookout," he said. "Being
high up, and that sycamore touching the window
nearly, it ain't unlike Zaccheus."</p>

<p>"That's no sycamore, Mr Peters. It's a plane."</p>

<p>"I don't know about such things. I ain't a talker
as a rule. It may be that I'm a bit excited at entering
on a new sp'ere, a sp'ere from which much may
be hoped. Not for worlds would I have 'em know in
the office that I've got ambitions&mdash;oh, no!"</p>

<p>The landlady moved to the door. "Will there be
anything else now?"</p>

<p>"A little tea, if it's not too much trouble," said
Peters. "I have a partiality for tea."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>"You shall have it," said Mrs Marks. She did a
good deal with the manner and the tone of the voice.
Peters vaguely understood that all this was exceptional,
and must not occur again; he must not make
a practice of taking up Mrs Marks's precious time by
sheer garrulousness; and he must not get into the
habit of ordering tea or anything else that he wanted&mdash;he
must wait until it was brought to him spontaneously.
He began to unpack his few belongings and
put them away neatly. He had a picture&mdash;an engraving
that he had purchased, ready framed, in
Melstowe. It represented David playing before
Saul. He hung it over the mantelpiece. Beneath
stood a partly-decayed model of a Swiss mountain
and ch&acirc;let, protected by a glass case.</p>

<p>When everything was tidy Peters sat down and
drank his tea, and thought about his ambitions.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Now, Mr Peters, as will have been gathered, was as
ignorant as a child of the manner in which promotion
takes place in a solicitor's office, and of the fact that
he had no chance whatever. He was conscientious
and patient, and could do mechanical work; he was
quite regular. Some men can do a thing one day which
they cannot do on the next, but Peters was never unexpected.
He was invariable in his merits, and in his
incompetence. With him Nature had drawn a line,
and said, "Peters, you are never going beyond that."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>His disappointment dawned very slowly upon him.
He found that a solicitor's office was not what he had
supposed it to be. Neither Grantham nor Flynders
was at all by way of being intimate with him; in
fact, they rarely spoke to him, except to dictate a
letter; it was the managing clerk who told him what
to do, and he always did it as well as he could, and
that was never very well, nor very badly. Sometimes
he thought with regret of the nearly social terms upon
which he had been with Flynders's cousin; Flynders's
cousin had taken his advice about the lemonade.
Now he was not on social terms with anybody. He
was not good at making friends. He did not get on
very well with the other clerks. They were not
serious; they played practical jokes upon him,
which he took, as a rule, with his accustomed mildness;
once or twice he lost his temper, and then he
was undignified but very funny.</p>

<p>His position was not in any danger. He was careful,
methodical, punctual. It was only that his step
upwards had been the last step that he was able to
take in that direction. He had found his level. In
the first few months of his appointment he had purchased
a large law-book second hand. He picked
that one because it was so very cheap, and it was so
very cheap because it was also so very obsolete; but
Peters did not know this. He studied his book, without
entirely understanding it, by the light of an evil-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>smelling
lamp in the long evenings. When his disappointment
had finally dawned upon him, he took
the book back to the second-hand bookseller and tried
to get him to purchase it again; but that was of no
use. It had taken the second-hand man some years
to sell that book once, and he did not feel inclined to
recommence the struggle. So Peters put it up on a
shelf and did his best to forget it. Now he read Mrs
Marks's newspaper (she obliged him with the loan of
it) in the evening. On one occasion another clerk
lent him something described as a regular spicy novel.
Peters read a few pages, but he did not like it, and
gave it back.</p>

<p>He began to be sorry that on his first arrival he had
been so confidential with his landlady; he had given
her a false impression, and he must correct it. So
one day he mentioned to her that he had relinquished
the notion of a partnership.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," she said. She had quite forgotten
about it, but one must verbally humour lodgers.
Besides, she had an apposite observation to make.
"I've often remarked," she said, "that if we <i>could</i>
all have everything we wanted, there wouldn't be
enough to go round."</p>

<p>Peters felt a little lonely. One day was very much
like another. He always went to bed at the same
time, and always rose at the same time. His life
seemed to be going on by machinery with himself left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
out of it. He had a fancy that it was the plane tree
which woke him in the morning; its boughs touched
lightly against his window sometimes when the wind
blew. He was rather attached to that tree. In the
summer it looked so cool and pleasant. There was a
door at the back of the house, leading on to that piece
of waste land, and he would have liked to have gone
outside and sat under the tree in the hot weather.
But he doubted if he had any right to use that back
door. He had a right to his two rooms and to the
front door and staircase which led to them; but he
was doubtful about the back door. On one or two
occasions he had inadvertently exceeded his rights,
and Mrs Marks had seemed to him rather put out.
As a matter of fact, Mrs Marks was very well satisfied
with him. He was a good lodger, gave no trouble,
and paid his book punctually; he rarely rang, never
seemed to mind if the bell was not answered, went to
church twice every Sunday, and was a credit to the
house. He was an economical man, and was putting
by a little money. He had a small sum of his own&mdash;&pound;20
a year&mdash;that his father had left him, or, as he
preferred to call it, a certain private income independent
of his salary. The days went on; the old
tree looked in at his window and seemed interested
in him, and he was interested in the tree, noting the
way it took the seasons. Otherwise there was nothing,
and it was rather lonely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>And then one day Mrs Marks brought him a piece
of news. Her little niece, Elsa, was coming to spend
a holiday with her. She thought she would mention
it, because there were some lodgers who objected to
children.</p>

<p>Of course Peters was delighted to say that he did
not object to children at all. "Oh, and about that
back door, Mrs Marks," he added. "I've sometimes
thought I'd like to make use of it, so as to sit out
under that tree of a warm evening."</p>

<p>"Most certainly, Mr Peters, and no need to ask
either."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Under the plane tree Peters found a thin girl, with
a white dress, black stockings, yellow hair, and a
large doll. He gazed at her mildly.</p>

<p>"Are you Elsa?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Are you the lodger?"</p>

<p>"Yes." He paused for want of ideas, and added
that it was a fine Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>She had much more self-possession than he had.
She looked at him critically. "Were you going to
sit out here, lodger?"</p>

<p>"I had been thinking of it."</p>

<p>"Well, do it then."</p>

<p>He sat down beside her, and said that she had a
nice doll.</p>

<p>"Yes; its name is Mrs Markham. I'm giving her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
up, because I'm nearly nine, and it's silly to keep on
with dolls when you're nearly grown up. I used to
have six dolls, and I've given them all up except Mrs
Markham. She'll have to go too."</p>

<p>"I say, how do you play with dolls?"</p>

<p>"You pretend things. Can you do that?"</p>

<p>"Bless you, yes!" said Peters, cheerfully. "I
can pretend anything you like. What shall it
be?"</p>

<p>"Let's pretend it's night."</p>

<p>"All right. It's night. And what do you do then?"</p>

<p>"Well, if it's night, of course we must put Mrs
Markham to bed. I've got her nightdress in my
pocket." She pulled it out and smoothed it on her
knee. "Now, I must undress her." But she did
not do it; she sat quite still, humming a little tune,
while Peters watched her with interest.</p>

<p>"What are you waiting for?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'm waiting," she said, with some severity, "for
you to look the other way. I can't undress Mrs
Markham while you're staring at her."</p>

<p>Peters blushed, apologised, and looked the other
way. Presently he was told that he might turn
round again; Mrs Markham was properly attired,
and asleep, with her head supported by part of a
brick.</p>

<p>"Capital!" exclaimed Peters.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Elsa, reproachfully. "It doesn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
seem as if you could pretend very well. Mrs Markham's
asleep, and so we must speak in whispers.
Now, what are you, besides being a lodger?"</p>

<p>"I'm a clerk to a firm of solicitors," Peters
replied, in the repressed and husky voice enjoined
upon him.</p>

<p>"That all?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so. I had expected to be one of the
firm, but there are difficulties. It seems to be usual
for a solicitor to be articled, and I doubt if the firm
will see its way to&mdash;"</p>

<p>Elsa yawned and interrupted. "That'll do. This
isn't any good. Let's play at something else. Can't
you think of <i>anything</i>?"</p>

<p>Peters had an idea. He passed a small confectioner's
shop on his way from business, and he
had observed and remembered a label in the window.</p>

<p>"Look here, Elsa, do you think you could manage
a liquorice jujube?"</p>

<p>Elsa looked down at the grass and waggled one
foot nervously; her eyes seemed to get larger.</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you," she said demurely, "I think I
could."</p>

<p>So they went off to the confectioner's shop. Peters
cross-examined the woman behind the counter almost
imperiously as to the presence of deleterious mineral
colouring matter in the desired sweetmeat. The
woman answered him with cold confidence:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>"The liquorice jujube takes its colour from the
liquorice, which is a vegetable and wholesome."</p>

<p>Then the purchase was made, and they sauntered
back&mdash;Elsa slowly becoming sticky, and Peters
smiling abundantly.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Peters was lonely no longer while Elsa's holiday
lasted. As a rule she made suggestions, and he acted
upon them. She wanted to know why he never
went on the river; so one afternoon he took her. A
man from the boat-house rowed them.</p>

<p>"Why don't you row yourself?" asked Elsa.</p>

<p>"Because," Peters answered, as he ran the boat's
nose hard into a thorn bush, "I have to steer. Mind
your head&mdash;I took that a little too close."</p>

<p>The man from the boat-house backed them out.
Similar incidents had occurred frequently since Peters
took the lines. At the boatman's suggestion he now
relinquished them.</p>

<p>In the course of her holiday Mrs Markham, so
Elsa said, died; she was buried under the plane tree.
Peters dug the grave with his pocket-knife and a
portion of a broken tea-cup. When the funeral
service was over Peters produced a toy cricket set,
and proposed a game. Elsa went in, and Peters
bowled. After an hour and a half she retired hot;
she was not out. Peters had bowled her twice, but
on each occasion the ball was disqualified by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
umpire. Elsa was the umpire. On the first occasion
he had forgotten to say play, and on the second
he had bowled faster than the rules of cricket permitted.
Peters did not get an innings&mdash;that was
characteristic of him.</p>

<p>On Sundays Peters took Elsa to church. She
refused to go more than once a Sunday, because
her father went only once; if she went twice,
she explained, it would be like saying that her
father was a bad man; and he was a very good
man. Peters asked her what prayers she said night
and morning.</p>

<p>"I used to have special ones," she said, "but I've
forgotten them. Besides, I'm too old for them;
they were baby things. Now I say any colic out of
the prayer-book. They're all good."</p>

<p>"I don't think that's quite right," said Peters.</p>

<p>"Pa," she observed, with subtle relevancy, "used
to say that all s'listers were liars."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm <i>not</i> a solicitor," Peters objected triumphantly.</p>

<p>He remembered two prayers for morning and evening
that he had learned when he was a boy. He
copied them out in an exquisite hand, with Old English
titles, on a sheet of tinted cardboard. Then he
ruled a frame round them&mdash;three thin red lines
within a broad black line. He was proud of his work.
He presented it to Elsa. The wayward Elsa chose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
to be pleased with it, and owned that Peters wrote
better than she did. She took the card away to her
room at once&mdash;"to try them," she explained.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Peters found himself very dull indeed when Elsa
had gone. He thought it over, and concluded that
he was a man who needed companionship. One
night he wrote a long letter&mdash;not a love-letter&mdash;to
Flynders's cousin's second daughter, and posted it;
he got no reply, and a few months afterwards
he read in Mrs Marks's newspaper the announcement
that Flynders's cousin's second daughter had
married the curate.</p>

<p>"She was always one for social success," Peters
reflected.</p>

<p>He wrote to Elsa, and she also did not answer&mdash;she
had explained to him that he must not expect it,
because she disliked writing letters. He sent her
every year a birthday card (with a present), a Christmas
card (also with a present), and a valentine. She
sent him, so far as he knew, nothing at all; but one
year he received a very ugly valentine, an insulting
valentine. He thought that it must have come either
from Elsa or from that young clerk who had lent him
the really spicy novel.</p>

<p>One day that young clerk seemed almost friendly
to Peters. "You're a lonely old chap," he said to
him in the luncheon hour. "Why don't you buy a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
dog? It would be a companion to you." Peters
thought it rather a good idea. As it happened, the
young clerk had one that he wanted to sell; he described
it as a faithful, pure-bred, sweet-tempered
fox-terrier. It's name was Tommy. Peters bought
it, and its kennel was located under the plane
tree.</p>

<p>Tommy liked almost everyone except Peters. He
would follow anyone except Peters. If he was in
the mood to snap at anybody, he preferred to snap at
Peters. Mrs Marks (under a special pecuniary arrangement)
agreed to wash the dog. But she soon
pleaded for the use of a muzzle on those occasions.</p>

<p>"For the way that dog turns against anything in
the shape of soap and water is pretty nigh human.
Instink, they calls it."</p>

<p>Peters thought that muzzles were inhuman, and
said that he would wash the dog himself. The first
time he tried Tommy bit him in three places, and
escaped before the operation was over. He bolted
into the street, ran away, and never came back.</p>

<p>So Peters was quite alone. Mrs Marks was
too busy to talk to him. Elsa did not come back.
But the old plane tree did not seem to mind him.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>As the years went on Peters found that he got old
very quickly. One of the effects of age, in his case,
was a violent pain in the chest, which came on after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
any great exertion or if he walked fast uphill. He
went for a holiday&mdash;a week at Hunstanton&mdash;but it
did not seem to do him much good. But when he
came back he heard glorious news. Elsa was coming
again for a few days.</p>

<p>"Now, I'm glad," said Peters. "I always liked
the child. Such bright ways she had! We shall soon
be playing cricket together again."</p>

<p>"Why, you forget, Mr Peters," said Mrs Marks.
"Elsa's near seventeen now. Besides, you're too
much of an invalid to think of running about.
You've aged." Mrs Marks herself did not age; she
was one of those hard, wiry women that are capable
of looking forty for twenty years.</p>

<p>Elsa looked very pretty. She still wore her hair
down, but her dresses were much longer. She had a
very superior manner, and did not seem particularly
glad to see Peters. She took one of the liquorice
jujubes that he offered her. But she explained that
she did not care about that sort now; she only liked
the best chocolates. "You can't get them here.
If you want to give me anything, Mr Peters, there's
a blouse (two-and-eleven) in Higginson's window
that would do me nicely."</p>

<p>He looked a little bewildered, but he bought her
the blouse, and it did her very nicely indeed&mdash;so
nicely that she thought it was a pity that she was not
to be photographed in it. "We might be photo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>graphed
together," she said alluringly; "I shouldn't
want more than two copies&mdash;cabinets."</p>

<p>This was better. Peters was pleased that she
wanted him to be photographed with her. The
photographer placed her on a rustic stile, with Peters
standing by her side. He smiled widely and with
feeling, as he looked at her. She shook her head
impatiently. "Oh, this won't do!" she said,
"your grinning puts me out. Besides, you shake the
stile. I wish you'd stand away and let me be done
alone. Then you can have yourself took afterwards."</p>

<p>So Peters stood away meekly. But on the whole
he did not think it worth while to have himself taken
afterwards.</p>

<p>The two copies arrived, and satisfied Elsa.
"Though I've known myself look better," she said.
One copy was for herself, and the other she destined
for a particular friend. Peters had bought a plush
frame, supposing that she had intended to give him
one copy; well, that did not matter; he could order a
third from the photographer. In the meantime he
was required to pack up the photograph for the particular
friend.</p>

<p>"It would travel safer," he said, "if you packed
it between a couple of pieces of card."</p>

<p>Elsa looked thoughtful. "I've got an old bit
in my writing-case," she said. "Go and fetch it,
Mr Peters."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>He hunted through the writing-case, but could not
find it.</p>

<p>"Well, I know it's there, anyhow," she retorted.
"I kept it, knowing it would come in some day. It's
got those prayers on it that you wrote out for me
when I was here before."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I saw that. I didn't think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, never mind, I'll go and get it myself; torn
in half, it will just do. It will puzzle my friend,
though&mdash;he's not one of the praying sort."</p>

<p>Peters was guilty of looking somewhat despondent
as he moved away; this made Elsa rather angry.
"You needn't look so glum," she said; "you didn't
expect me to keep it all my life, and have it buried
with me&mdash;silly old card&mdash;did you?"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"One thing I will say," Mrs Marks observed, after
Elsa had gone, "is that she does brighten up a house.
And I hope her looks mayn't be a snare to her. She
has one young admirer already, and she a mere child!
She's promised to come again next year. I hope
you'll get on better with her then. You seemed
more stand-offish this time&mdash;you've no complaint
against her?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! certainly not."</p>

<p>"You're not looking well, Mr Peters. You'll
excuse my mentioning it, but you want a doctor."</p>

<p>Peters shook his head slowly, but owned to a touch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
of something&mdash;probably liver. It was Sunday evening,
and he had been intending to go to church as
usual. But he changed his mind. He did not feel
up to it. He sat under the plane tree and thought
about Elsa as she used to be before she grew up.</p>

<p>He knew that old tree well now, knew every twist of
the branches, every kink of the bark. In an unreasoning
way he loved the tree. It had never repulsed
him; it had always been there for him.</p>

<p>Mrs Marks was right. Peters did want a doctor.
He took to fainting when he was at work at the office.
He apologised for it to the senior partner, who had
found him unconscious, and promised that it should
not occur again. But it did. One morning he was
summoned to the senior partner's private room.
Grantham and Flynders were both there. They told
him that he had been for many years a faithful servant
to them, and that now&mdash;when he was past work&mdash;they
wanted to mark their sense of his services. He
was not to come to the office any more, but they
named a sum which would be paid him by way of
pension for the rest of his life. And they advised
him to see a doctor.</p>

<p>Peters could not understand it, and it had to be
explained to him again. Then he tried to thank
them. He felt proud and tremulous. He had been
praised&mdash;it was years since anybody had praised him.
He walked home and told Mrs Marks about it. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
was not to work any more. Grantham &amp; Flynders
had praised him very highly. And he had a pension.
And Mrs Marks congratulated him, and said that he
deserved his luck. And finally Peters broke down
and wept.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Peters spent most of his days, doing absolutely
nothing, stretched on the grass under the plane tree.
He had grown rather queer in one or two points.
Mrs Marks could not make him believe that the strip
of land was to be built over, and that the tree would
have to come down. He did not argue about it. He
merely said, "They shall not cut that tree down. I
shall see about it."</p>

<p>"Now that <i>is</i> silly, Mr Peters. The tree <i>will</i> come
down before they begin to build."</p>

<p>"No, it will not," said Peters.</p>

<p>One day, while Peters was lying under the tree, a
party of men came and took measurements, and cut
lines in the turf, but they did not attempt to touch
the tree. Peters chuckled.</p>

<p>But next morning he was awakened by a sound of
sawing. A party of labourers had come early, and
were at work on the tree, sawing off the heavy lower
boughs. Peters leant half out of the window in his
night-shirt and shook his fist at them. He was wild
with excitement.</p>

<p>"Leave my tree alone!" he screamed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>The men stopped work for a minute. Two of them
laughed. One of them shouted up to him:</p>

<p>"Hold your row, you old fool! It ain't your tree."</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> mine," cried Peters. "I shall come down
to you and stop you. I'm coming now." Then he
fell back on the bed fainting.</p>

<p>Mrs Marks was much alarmed, and&mdash;whether
Peters liked it or not&mdash;insisted on having a doctor.</p>

<p>When the doctor came downstairs she met him in
the passage. "Well, sir?" she said.</p>

<p>"I can do nothing&mdash;might have done if I'd been
called in years ago. It's the heart. He can't last
long. Don't let him be excited, and I'll send you
something to give him for these fainting attacks."</p>

<p>Mrs Marks was a hard woman, but she wiped her
eyes with her apron. "He's been here so long, you
see," she explained.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Peters protested against the doctor. It was a
foolish expense, if he was certain to die.</p>

<p>"I've got a little put by&mdash;yes, that's true. But
it's all to go to Elsa, you see, and I don't want any of
it wasted."</p>

<p>The blinds were drawn in order that he might not
be excited by seeing the felling of the tree; but he
could hear the work going on, though he pressed his
thin hands to his ears.</p>

<p>As the sun shone in at his window one morning, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
he lay awake in bed, a big, swift shadow swept across
the blind, and then came a deafening crash.</p>

<p>Peters half raised himself in bed, one hand on
his heart. His voice came in a whisper, "My God!"</p>

<p>He sank quite gently back again on the bed, and
did not move.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE NIGHT OF GLORY</h2>


<p>It was half-past six at night when she came down
from the workrooms and out into the street.
She was an intensely an&aelig;mic girl, neatly dressed,
thin, tired. Given better health, she would not have
been unattractive; given a better way of life, she
would have had better health.</p>

<p>A gentleman of forty-five crossed the street towards
her, raised his hat, and said, "You're late to-night."</p>

<p>She took absolutely no notice, and slightly quickened
in her pace.</p>

<p>"Please do not hurry," he said. "I have so much
to say to you." Then she turned round on him and
was very furious. If he bothered her any more she
would hand him over to the police.</p>

<p>"Pray don't misunderstand me," said the gentleman,
plaintively; "I would not insult you or treat you
with anything but the greatest respect on any account."</p>

<p>"Then what on earth do you want?" she said
rather irritably.</p>

<p>"I will put it as briefly as I can. I happen to be
very wealthy. I can enjoy nothing&mdash;the day for
that has gone past for me. I wish for one night to
see somebody else enjoy something. It had to be
somebody who did not usually spend money freely;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
somebody who worked hard; somebody who had
refinement and education. I thought, and I still
think, that I have found all these things in you. Will
you come with me? Dinner, a theatre or a music-hall,
a little supper at the Carlton, and then my
brougham shall drive you home. You will be rendering
me the greatest possible service."</p>

<p>She was a girl that was quite used to taking care
of herself. If she had not much confidence in him,
she had great confidence in herself. She could, at
any rate, test it, and abandon the experiment when it
pleased her.</p>

<p>"But," she said, "I have no proper dress for that
kind of thing."</p>

<p>"You know what the proper dress would be?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do. It's my business."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, the rest is simple. You will go
immediately and get all that you require in that way&mdash;dress,
gloves, everything. Do not think about
money, merely exercise the excellent taste which you
show in your present costume. If the dress gives
you the least pleasure, I know that it will give me
much more. I shall be your debtor."</p>

<p>"It is like a fairy tale," she said.</p>

<p>"My brougham is here, and at your service."</p>

<p>The electric brougham slid noiselessly up to them.
They got in.</p>

<p>In the brougham she watched him nervously, side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>ways.
Yes, he was forty-five. His dark hair was
grey on the temples; there was a melancholy cruelty
in his thin-lipped mouth; but the greenish eyes,
strong and searching, were not the eyes of one who
had out-lived himself.</p>

<p>"I can't understand," she said. "What do you
mean? You can't enjoy anything?"</p>

<p>"Almost that. I am, unfortunately, one who
must have novelty. There are many women to
whom I have given pretty toys and suppers at the
Carlton. That&mdash;well, that was another affair. This
is quite different. To-night I give for no other motive
than to bring enjoyment to you. You see? I shall
enjoy it second-hand. Tell me all about the dress."</p>

<p>She laughed. "Oh! you wouldn't understand if
I did. I am going to Lambert's. One of the ladies
there is a great friend of mine. Lucky that I am
stock size, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Very," said the man, with enthusiasm. He had
not the faintest notion what stock size meant.</p>

<p>When the brougham stopped at Lambert's she
seemed a little troubled. "Half an hour is the least
time I can possibly be," she said. "You won't like
waiting."</p>

<p>"Like it? It will be a luxury to me. Nobody
has dared to make me wait for twenty years. You
shall do it. Your foot is on my neck. Seriously, I
have one or two little things to do myself. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
meantime"&mdash;he handed her a roll of notes&mdash;"get
everything you want and pay for it."</p>

<p>She was fully three-quarters of an hour away, but
she was a very transfigured maiden when the commissionaire
opened the door of the brougham for her.
Excitement, or a touch of rouge, had put a little colour
into her pale face. Her dark hair was beautiful, and
becomingly dressed. For the rest, all was perfect,
from that shapely head down to the white satin shoes.</p>

<p>"Will this do?" she said eagerly.</p>

<p>"It is superb. You are transformed."</p>

<p>"That's quite true," she said. "I don't seem to
myself to be the same kind of person. I don't think
the same way. Oh! please, it didn't take nearly all
that money. Look, I have got it here somewhere."
She fumbled under her cloak.</p>

<p>"Oh! please don't bother," said her companion.
"You may want it later for something or other. See
what I have been doing to fill in time."</p>

<p>He took from its box an old ivory fan exquisitely
painted, and handed it to her.</p>

<p>"That fan," he said, "belonged once to a princess,
a daughter of George the Third. She was his favourite
daughter, and it was her death which finally dethroned
his reason. Take it; you also are a princess
to-night."</p>

<p>"I cannot thank you&mdash;I cannot even begin to thank
you. It is like a most heavenly dream coming true."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pray don't speak of thanks. It is I who am
indebted to you for being pleased. I have bought
another little toy for you as well."</p>

<p>He opened a case, containing a necklace of pearls,
a single row. Not of great size, but well matched and
graduated.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," he said, "that this has no romantic
history. The best I can imagine is that the diver who
brought the pearls was snapped in two by a shark."</p>

<p>"The best?" she cried. "That is the worst!
That is horrible! Oh! but what a lovely necklace!"</p>

<p>"Then," said the man, "he was not snapped in
two by a shark. He amassed great wealth in the
pearl fishery business, retired from it, married a wife,
had seventeen children, and was very, very happy."</p>

<p>"Seventeen seems a lot," said the girl.</p>

<p>"To-night you have only to command. The poor
man had but two. May I put the necklace on for
you?"</p>

<p>She hesitated. After all, why be a fool? "Of
course, if you like," she said.</p>

<p>He fastened the snap quickly and deftly. "That
is the way pearls look best," he said.</p>

<p>She rubbed her eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh! don't do that," said the man.</p>

<p>She laughed. "I was trying to wake up," she said.</p>

<p>"Don't wake up. But as we now know one
another so well shall we say what our names are?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, your lordship," said the girl, a little timidly,
"my name is Appleby&mdash;Marion Appleby."</p>

<p>"Not 'your lordship'; Lord Alcester, please."</p>

<p>Presently she had recovered from the shock of the
introduction, and was eating iced Cantaloup melon.
She looked pleased with the world. She tasted
everything, and drank a very little champagne.</p>

<p>His lordship dined principally on dry toast and old
brandy. He was evidently well known and appreciated
in the restaurant.</p>

<p>"Tell me all about yourself," he said to her.
"What is your ordinary day like?"</p>

<p>"That is what I'd like to forget just now," she said.
"We live in Fulham, and it's a big family. Father's
a very highly-educated man and speaks three languages.
He is a clerk in a very good position; but still,
you see, there are so many of us, and mamma's
health isn't good. I am up early every morning
seeing to the children, and there is my own work all
day, and those workrooms are awful in the summer;
then there is the walk back, or sometimes a 'bus if I
am very tired, and after that there is always something
to do about the house before I go to bed."</p>

<p>"Any holidays?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes. We have our fortnight at the sea every
summer. Father says that is not a luxury but a
necessity, and he'd save in almost any way sooner
than give that up. I believe he's right, too; you'd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
hardly know me after a fortnight at Margate, if the
weather's been good. I get tanned, but I don't
freckle. That's luck, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It is the luckiest thing in the world. Waiter, I
want a box at the Frivolity to-night; see about it,
please. If there is no box to be had I will not take
stalls, I will go somewhere else. And, Miss Appleby,
what do you suppose a day of my life is like?"</p>

<p>"I haven't the least idea."</p>

<p>"It is far harder work than yours, and much
duller. Believe me, my child, there is no toil so hard
or so absolutely uninteresting as the toil that one goes
through in order to enjoy one's self. In August,
when I go North for the shooting, I still enjoy a
little pleasure&mdash;at any rate, the life there is not
too actively disgusting. But the London season&mdash;and
I would far sooner die than miss any London
season&mdash;is, if I may use the expression, unmitigated
hell."</p>

<p>"I think," the girl said, "that I could be happy if
I were you."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly&mdash;for six months; not always.
This is really the only pleasant evening that I have
spent this summer."</p>

<p>"What made you think of it? Why did you
choose me?"</p>

<p>"An all-merciful Providence that did not desire
that I should slit my throat out of sheer boredom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
made me think of it. I waited, and I saw the rest
of your companions pass out from the shop. Not one
of them would have suited me. Frankly, they are all
a little vulgar, and, which is far worse, a little uninteresting.
You, on the other hand, are quite charming.
You possess a fascination peculiar to yourself."</p>

<p>"What is it?" the girl asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>"You are very good, and you have a potentiality
of being very bad. If you had been very bad, with a
potentiality of being very good, you would also have
fascinated me. I like potentiality in others, for there
is none in myself. I shall never be any better and I
could not be any worse, and I don't care two straws
either way. Let's talk about something more interesting
than myself. What? Oh! the box at the
Frivolity. Very well, shall we go, my child, or
would you like to change your mind and go to
something else?"</p>

<p>It was quite late that night when he put her carefully
into his brougham, shook hands with her, refused
to hear a word of thanks, and gave the coachman
the address in Fulham to which he was to take her.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Five years had done a good deal. They had nearly,
but not quite, killed Lord Alcester. This winter
night, bent, wizened, wrapped in furs, and leaning
heavily on his stick, he crawled slowly along Piccadilly
on his way from one club to another.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>An ungloved hand touched his arm, and a hoarse
woman's voice said, "Half a moment, my lord."</p>

<p>He gave her one quick glance from under his heavy
eyebrows. Those eyes were not dead yet.</p>

<p>"It won't do," said Lord Alcester.</p>

<p>The girl laughed bitterly. "I thought you might
like to look at your work," she said. "You were the
ruin of me five years ago."</p>

<p>"My good woman," said Lord Alcester. "If I
stopped in Piccadilly to talk to all the women who
think I have been the ruin of them, it would stop the
traffic. Let me go, please."</p>

<p>She still clung to his arm. "Just half a moment,"
she said. "The work-girl whom you gave a pretty
dress to, and a string of pearls, and a fan that once
belonged to a princess. You remember?"</p>

<p>"Good God!" said Lord Alcester. "Where can
we talk?"</p>

<p>She laughed again, the same bitter laugh, and surveyed
her reflection in a shop-window.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "a box at the Frivolity wouldn't
do for me now, would it? Here, I know of a place, if
you'll follow me."</p>

<p>"All right," said Lord Alcester. "Walk slowly."</p>

<p>She led him by side-streets into back-streets. The
little public-house was very quiet, discreet, sinful and
unsavoury. She pushed her way through to a little
room behind the bar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now then," she said.</p>

<p>With difficulty Lord Alcester dragged off his heavy
fur coat and flung himself down on the crimson
velveteen.</p>

<p>"What a godless hole this is," he said. "What
are you going to have?"</p>

<p>"Glass of port," she said promptly.</p>

<p>"You haven't taken to spirits yet?"</p>

<p>"I keep that for the mornings. Shall I ring the
bell?"</p>

<p>He nodded. The waiter who entered looked curiously
from one to another. Lord Alcester had a firm,
quiet, impressive manner.</p>

<p>"You will bring me," he said, "a bottle of the best
port you have and a small bottle of soda-water.
Make up that fire."</p>

<p>"I never said a bottle," said the woman. "Are
you going to drink the rest?"</p>

<p>"I am going to drink the soda-water. Don't talk
about that. Sit down by the fire. Warm your
hands and tell me about yourself."</p>

<p>It was not until she had finished her first glass of
port that she began on the subject. "There is no
more to say than what I said before," she said. "You
were my ruin."</p>

<p>"I remember that night very distinctly. I never
made love to you. I never tried to kiss you. I never
treated you with any less respect than I would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
treated a woman of my own class. What are you
talking about? What is all this nonsense?"</p>

<p>"No nonsense at all. How did you think it would
be when I got home that night with fifty pounds'
worth of new clothes, and my pearl necklace, and a
story of a theatre and supper afterwards? Do you
think they would believe my word at home? They
said they did; I have got a temper, and they daren't
say anything else; but they let me see very well that
they didn't believe me. I wasn't going to stand it.
Next morning at breakfast, when they were all full of
the thing, I gave them some straight talking, and then
I cleared out."</p>

<p>"Am I responsible for the heat of your temper and
the straightness of your talking?"</p>

<p>"You might have guessed how it would be with
me. Did you think that after one night of glory like
that I was going back to perpetual drudgery? I'd
seen life as it might be, and I'd been given a bad name.
I'd only got to deserve it."</p>

<p>"How much did you get for the pearl necklace?"</p>

<p>"Three hundred and fifty."</p>

<p>"Then you were swindled."</p>

<p>"I know that, of course. I told them so. What
did it matter? It was all gone in a few weeks. I
can tell you I made money fly in those days. That's
all past. I've lost what little good looks I ever had,
haven't I?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>"Quite," said Lord Alcester, mercilessly. "You
drink, you see," he added.</p>

<p>The girl put down her glass and fumbled desperately
for a dirty little handkerchief with her face screwed
awry. She dabbed at her eyes and shook with
sobs.</p>

<p>"Stop that," said Lord Alcester. "You are making
the devil of a row. Look here, come to business."</p>

<p>"I might have been good," she moaned. "If I
had never met you I might have been good."</p>

<p>Lord Alcester was writing something on one of
his visiting-cards. He stepped over to her and touched
her on the shoulder. "Can you read that address?"
he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said between her sobs. "Lincoln's
Inn Fields. Solicitors, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Quite so," said Lord Alcester, as he struggled
back into his coat again. "They'll give you a pound
a week as long as you live. Call for it on Saturday
mornings. I could also give you plenty of good
advice, but I won't. Are you coming?"</p>

<p>She glanced at the decanter by her side. "Not
quite yet," she said. "I think I'll just&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! I see," said Lord Alcester, contemptuously.
"Good-night, then."</p>

<p>Out in the street he stopped the first hansom that
he saw. The man had often driven him before.</p>

<p>"What will you take," he said to the man, "to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
drive this cab to eternal smash? Drive it, for instance,
down the Duke of York's steps?"</p>

<p>The cabman smiled patiently. "Which club did
you say, my lord?" Lord Alcester gave the
address of his club and got into the cab.</p>

<h2>AN IDYLL OF THE SEA</h2>


<p>The repellent mid-day meal grew to its untidy
close in a frowsy boarding-house in one of the
less-pleasing back streets of Sefton-on-Sea. Mr
Sigismund Porter had eaten so remarkably little that
he might almost have won an approving smile from
the hawk-eyed proprietress. As a rule, Mr Porter
was a young man who liked value for his money, but
to-day there was something on his mind, a gloomy
resolution which destroyed his appetite.</p>

<p>"I am going," he said to himself, "to put my cards
down on the table. I am going to own up, and to act
on the square, and to be chucked for doing it, and to
leave this blighted place to-morrow."</p>

<p>In his small bedroom at the very top of the house he
arrayed himself with his usual scrupulous care. He
wore a pair of the yellowest boots in Sefton-on-Sea,
waistcoat and trousers of grey flannel, a dark blue
smoking-jacket of the reach-me-down or Edgware
Road order, and a straw hat adorned with the bewitching
colours of the Advance Guard Cycling Club.
His necktie was of the palest saffron, saving for such
stains as it had acquired by natural wear and tear. He
surveyed himself in the looking-glass and was satisfied.</p>

<p>Considering that he was really rather a nice-looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
young man, he was a pretty bad sight. He had dark,
wavy hair, and a girl had once said that he had the
most pathetic eyes in Brixton. He lived at Brixton,
and so did the girl. That was now merely an incident
in the dead past.</p>

<p>He selected one of those cigarettes the principal
characteristic of which is that you get an amazing
amount of them for threepence. He shut the case
with a snap&mdash;a real silver case which gave him
pleasure&mdash;and so he went forth jauntily. He was
going to his doom, of course, and he knew that he was
going to his doom. But as his way to his doom lay
along the sea-front, it was as well for the present to
keep up appearances. From the sea-front he reached
the pier, cast down his penny at the turnstiles, and
walked up to the further end of it to a secluded seat
behind the little pavilion where they let the entertainments
loose. There he waited, leaning forward with
his rather weak chin on the handle of his walking-stick.
For a moment the wicked thought flashed
across him that there was no necessity for him to
put his cards down on the table, that he might as well
have played the game out to the end. He cast the
temptation from him. He would lose the girl, of
course, but there was the very devil in it. He would
rather lose her fairly than leave her with the glittering
but untrue portrait of himself that she must now
possess.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked up and saw the girl herself walking
towards him.</p>

<p>"Walks like a queen," he said to himself.
"Walks as if she'd bought the whole place, and
could pay for it&mdash;and she gets thirty bob a week
from a Dover Street milliner. You couldn't hardly
believe it." Then he arose and lifted his absurd hat.</p>

<p>The girl shook hands with him frankly. She was
simply and quietly dressed, but perhaps her profession
gave her advantages there.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Mr Porter," she said. "You
are getting splendid weather for your last day here."
She was a pretty girl with enigmatical eyes, and her
voice was softer and pleasanter than the voice of Mr
Sigismund Porter.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr Porter, gloomily, "the weather's a
bit of all right, I suppose, if the weather were everything."</p>

<p>"But the weather is quite a good deal, isn't it?"
said the girl, cheerfully. "You wouldn't enjoy your run
on your motor-car up to the Lakes if it came on wet."</p>

<p>"There ain't going to be any run," said the young
man.</p>

<p>"What? But what about your friends&mdash;Colonel
Raynes and Lord Daybrooke? You can't disappoint
them."</p>

<p>"I shan't," he said bitterly. "They won't be disappointed,
because they don't exist. I haven't got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
any colonels and lords amongst my friends. It was
all lies and brag. For that matter, I haven't got
any friends except one girl, and she's just going to
give me the chuck for taking her in."</p>

<p>"I see," said the girl, thoughtfully. "Would you
mind very much if we left this disgusting, vulgar
little pier and walked along by the sands? They
begin to make music of sorts here directly, and it will
be quieter out of the crowd."</p>

<p>The thought flashed into his mind that it was
hardly worth while to pay a penny for the pier and
leave it at the end of five minutes, for his mind was
perforce economical. But money questions at the
moment seemed too sordid.</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "Considering the way I've
carried on&mdash;I may say the rotten way I've carried on&mdash;it's
pretty decent of you to hear the story out. I
suppose I could kick up some sort of an excuse."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I could find the excuses for you," said
the girl, as they went down together on to the beach.
"You are not really stopping at the Grand, then?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not. I've been stopping at the cheapest
and muckiest boarding-house in the place, and in a
mortal funk all the time lest you should see me going
in and out. Well, that's all over, at any rate. You
know the worst now. The way it started was that I
wanted to impress you a bit. I wanted to make
myself out one of the lucky ones. I wanted to seem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
a superior class to you altogether. And that's the
damned funny thing about it, if you'll excuse my
swearing. All the time that I was bragging about
motor-cars, and you were talking about the stuffy
workrooms, you were the superior class to me, and
I was the dirt under your feet. Looking back on it,
I can't think how I came to make such a fool of
myself. Your superior, indeed! Why, even on the
outside facts I'm not that, for I only make twenty-eight
bob to your thirty, and I haven't got your
chance of a rise."</p>

<p>"I think I see how it all happened," said the girl.
"It was all very natural. I was sorry you told me
those fibs, but I was not half as sorry then as I am
glad now when you've taken them back again."</p>

<p>"Hold on," said the man. "I mean, just half a
moment, if you don't mind. You said you were
sorry when I began blowing about my position and
all that. You knew, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the girl. "I knew all the time. And
all the time I was rather thinking that you wouldn't
go on with it."</p>

<p>The young man stared at her hard. "You beat
me altogether," he said. "I can't make head or tail
of it. Of course, you've had opportunities of picking
up style in your work, and there's no manner of doubt
that you've got it. Well, I've known other girls who
worked at a milliner's who have done the same.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
What beats me is that you've got that way of thinking.
That's where they slip up. They say it all
right, but what they say is all wrong. It's the same
here, for the matter of that," he added gloomily.</p>

<p>"Now I want to talk to you," said the girl. "We
are out of the crowd here. Let's sit down. I've got
to apologise to you too, you know. I've told you lies,
too. I never worked for a milliner in my life. I've
got a motor-car and more money than I want, and
I am stopping at the very hotel where you said you
were."</p>

<p>"I take it," said the young man, quietly, "that
this is about the last straw. If you'll permit one
question, miss, that being the case, why on earth did
you ever let me speak to you?"</p>

<p>"We will both be honest now," said the girl. "I
saw you several times, and always alone. You did
not seem to be having a particularly happy holiday.
I saw that you wanted to talk to me. The book that
I left on the seat gave you your chance, but I did not
leave my book there on purpose. I had not even
made up my mind at the moment when you brought
it to me what I would do. When you began to talk, I
saw that right at the back of all the talk you were
quite a good young man. You always treated me
properly and with respect."</p>

<p>"The man's not been born yet who would dare do
anything else."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl laughed. "Well, I was inclined to like
you. I don't value what you call the outside facts
so very, very much. I rather like doing something
unconventional, if it is not actually wrong. I thought
it would please you if I let you meet me sometimes."</p>

<p>"That's rather a mild way of putting it."</p>

<p>"It pleased me too. At the back of everything
that was wrong in you there were such lots and lots of
good. I don't want you to look on it as simply an idle
experiment on my part. Perhaps there was a slight
shade of that in it, and I am rather ashamed of it.
But it was chiefly that I wanted you to have a rather
happier time here."</p>

<p>"I believe all that," said Mr Porter, "and I did
have a happier time here. But think how I've got to
pay for it afterwards. There's the contempt you must
have felt for me&mdash;that's a nice sort of thing to have in
your mind when you can't sleep at night! By God!"
he burst out with sudden ferocity, "you lied worse
than I did. You did more harm."</p>

<p>"Now you talk like a man," she said. "But
you're mistaken on one point. There was never any
contempt. All the time I was thinking that in your
circumstances I should probably have been sorely
tempted to do exactly as you did. Think of that
when you can't sleep."</p>

<p>"That isn't everything," said the young man,
jabbing holes in the sand with his stick.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>"Isn't it?" said the girl. "What's the rest?"</p>

<p>"Thanks," said the young man, bitterly, "but I'm
not going to make a fool of myself again. You go
and become what you pretended to be. Come to me
as a thirty-bob-a-week girl, working for a milliner,
then I'll tell you the rest fast enough. Now I'm
going to say 'Good-bye' to you."</p>

<p>"I think I see," said the girl. "That could never
have been in any circumstances. But because I want
you to know that I'm a friend to you, good-bye."
She held out both her hands to him. "And remember
this." Then she put her face up to his and kissed
him.</p>

<p>In a moment she was gone.</p>

<p>The young man remained standing there. "And,"
he said to himself, "one ought to go straight up to
heaven in a chariot of golden fire."</p>

<h2>THE MAGIC RINGS</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Part I.&mdash;Netta, the Make-Believer</span></h3>

<p>Netta's father one day picked her up, swung
her into the air, and put her down on the top
of the high Italian cabinet in the hall. "There, you
little slut," he said, "what does the world look like
from up there?"</p>

<p>"Quite different; you wouldn't know it. The
pictures look so queer&mdash;upside down; and the staircase
isn't the same&mdash;or anything. Can't you come
up too?"</p>

<p>"No; I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"Did you know there were two&mdash;no, three&mdash;big
rings up here on the top of the cabinet? You can't
see them from down below. May I bring them down?"</p>

<p>"If you like."</p>

<p>They were three disused wooden curtain rings, very
dusty.</p>

<p>"How did they get there?" asked Netta.</p>

<p>"That," said her father, "is one of the things that
I do not know; ask somebody else."</p>

<p>So she asked her mother, her governess, her nurse,
and all the servants. They also did not know. They
supposed that somebody must have put them there
some time. Netta went back to her father and ob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>tained
permission to have those rings for her own.
She carried them out into the garden into a secluded
place under a weeping ash. There she examined the
rings very carefully, and thought about the mystery
which surrounded them. When she took them upstairs
she showed them to her nurse.</p>

<p>"These are the magic rings," she said.</p>

<p>"Are they, indeed, now?" said the nurse, used to
being interested, fictitiously, but at the shortest
notice, in anything childish.</p>

<p>On the next day Netta felt the need of a temple.
The romance of the rings was growing rapidly. Invested
with a mysterious origin and properties not
yet fully defined, but vaguely magical, they required
to be enshrined in a temple. For one night they had
put up with the shelter of the toy-cupboard. But in
view of their character they were now to have a place
apart. Netta went to her father and asked him if
he had an empty box that he could spare.</p>

<p>"Would a cardboard box do?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It ought to be pure white, though."</p>

<p>The pure white cardboard box was found and given
to her. This became the temple. Netta placed the
three magic rings in it, and called her brother, who
was a year older than she, and at that time rather a
pious little prig.</p>

<p>"Would you like to see what's in that box, Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"I don't much mind."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a temple, and I don't think I shall let you. I
certainly shan't let <i>everybody</i>."</p>

<p>"You ought to let me see, because I'm your brother."</p>

<p>"Well, first of all I must write your name inside
the lid. Everyone who is allowed to see into the
temple is going to be written down there. You're
not to look until I've done it." She wrote the name
as neatly as she could with a long new pencil, beautifully
pointed. "Now you can look," she said.</p>

<p>"It isn't anything at all. It's only three old rings."</p>

<p>"Yes, but they're magic rings."</p>

<p>"Pooh! They can't do anything."</p>

<p>"Can't they?" said Netta with immense indifference,
as she replaced the lid. She sat on the table,
swinging her slim legs, and hummed provokingly.</p>

<p>"I <i>know</i> they can't do anything," Jimmy repeated.</p>

<p>Netta looked away from him, up at the flies circling
on the white ceiling. Her eyes grew big and meditative.
She continued humming.</p>

<p>"Well," said Jimmy, desperately, "what <i>can</i>
they do?"</p>

<p>"Every night when you're in bed and asleep, and
when everybody else is in bed and asleep, they can
come out of the temple and run about. They run
up walls and along the roofs of houses. And they
can fly, too. They fly just like&mdash;like flies."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it. You're being a liar, and you
know where liars go to. You ought to be punished."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm not being a liar. I might be a make-believer,
perhaps, but I shan't say if I am. Nobody
knows where those rings came from. Papa himself
doesn't know."</p>

<p>"I shall go and ask him this minute myself."
Jimmy walked firmly to the door, paused, and added,
"And lying is the same as make-believing."</p>

<p>He found his father, and asked him if he knew
where those rings that Netta had came from.</p>

<p>"No," said his father, "I told her I didn't."</p>

<p>Jimmy was disappointed. "Lying and make-believing
are the same thing, aren't they?" he said.</p>

<p>"Not at all the same thing." This was yet another
disappointment. Later in the day Jimmy went to
Netta and said that she really ought to give him one
of those rings as he was her brother. She refused.
He then asked if he might look inside the temple at
them again. Once more he was refused.</p>

<p>"It is not a good thing," said Netta, gravely, "to
look at them too much in one day."</p>

<p>"It seems as if I couldn't do anything or have anything,
or play at anything," said Jimmy, gloomily.
Netta, being tender-hearted, relented, and allowed
him to look once more.</p>

<p>Netta had girl-friends of her own age. They were
Dorothy, and Cecilia Vane, and Rose Heritage.
Netta told them about the magic rings, and they were
all deeply impressed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>A ritual sprang up. Netta was the priestess and
Rose Heritage was the under-priestess. It became
necessary always to wave a green leaf slowly over the
temple before opening it. Every morning the magic
rings were taken out and placed for a few minutes in a
basin of pure water. Then they were dried and put
back again in the temple. Dorothy Vane, who read
deeply, suggested amulets, and they were made at
once. Each girl wore round her neck a gold thread&mdash;it
had come off a box of crackers&mdash;and to the thread
was attached a small square of white cardboard, on
which three circles had been drawn. Netta and Rose
had amulets on which the circles were drawn in red
chalk. Dorothy and Cecilia had to be content with
black ink. But it was understood that after a certain
time Dorothy would be raised to the position of
under-priestess, and then she also would have the red-chalk
privilege. The amulets were to be worn under
the dress, and to be shown to no one. The secrecy
observed was tremendous. Nobody was to know
anything. When engaged with the magic rings,
Christian names were forbidden. Netta was addressed
as the priestess and Rose as the under-priestess;
Dorothy was called One and Cecilia Two.
Of course, Two was the least honourable position. It
had been assigned to Cecilia because, owing to her
sweet and gentle disposition, she consented to take
it&mdash;which none of the other three would have done.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
Jimmy was by unanimous vote left out of it altogether.
They would ask him if he would not go and
play in the garden, like a kind boy, because they had
some private secrets to talk about; and if he came
suddenly into the room where they were they hid
things hurriedly and talked ostentatiously about the
weather. This maddened Jimmy. Sometimes he
said that he knew all about it, and at other times
pointed out to Netta that the claims of their relationship
required that she should tell him all about it,
and at other times that he did not want to know.
Occasionally he threatened to throw the temple and
the magic rings (he called them "old curtain-rings,"
but that was only his offensiveness) into the duck-pond.
He did not do it. The devotees were four in
number, and he was only one, and foolhardiness is not
courage. "Anyhow," he said, "if you weren't doing
wrong, you'd let me into it, and so you're certain to
be punished. I have got secrets of my own and mine
are not wrong, but I shan't say anything about
them." But he prevailed nothing.</p>

<p>The legends about the magic rings grew rapidly in
number and in strength. Their origin was now accounted
for. They had been hoops belonging to the
fairies, and they had undergone trundling so willingly
and beautifully that the fairies had set them free and
given them magical powers. This aetiological myth
was, like the rest, given out by big-eyed Netta, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
make-believer, and received with wonderment and
satisfaction by her followers. The magic rings always
lived a day on ahead; what is merely Monday to us
was Tuesday to them. Reports of their nocturnal
wanderings were received from time to time. They
frequently went to the moon. They could fly like
flies, it will be remembered. Once they went to the
Star of Dolls. This star is inhabited by dolls only,
and they can talk. A penny exercise book was procured
(the generous and sweet-tempered Cecilia defraying
the total expense), and in it the myths were
written out, together with certain rules to be observed.
It was called the "Volume of the Magic Rings," and
the under-priestess had charge of it just as the
priestess had charge of the temple. Letters passed
freely between the four girls. I give the one which
was the beginning of the end:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dearest Priestess</span>,&mdash;When you bring the
temple with you to tea on their Thursday wich is our
Wensday, mind to bring two handkercheeves, and
one of them must be clean. This is important. I
have something to show you. I hope you tell Jimy
nothing.&mdash;Your loving</p>

<p style='text-align:right'>
"<span class="smcap">Under-Priestess.</span>"<br />
</p></div>

<p>The other girls had received similar instructions.
Cecilia had been told to bring her musical-box as well.
They all met in Rose's schoolroom, and at first she
did not explain her instructions fully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've got a splendid thing," she said. "First of all,
when I say 'Go,' you must all run after me at once,
bringing the things with you, and then when we get
there I'll tell you the rest."</p>

<p>Rose's governess was with them at tea, but afterwards
she made ready to go out into the garden, suggesting
that they should come too.</p>

<p>"May we wait a little and then come?" asked
Rose. "We want to play in the house first."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Miss Stagg. "Don't get into
any mischief."</p>

<p>The moment she had gone Rose said "Go!" In
single file, with Rose leading, they ran down a long
passage and into the spare bedroom at the end of it.</p>

<p>"Now, then," said Rose, "first of all, we tie clean
white handkerchiefs on our heads." It was done.
"Now, come and look."</p>

<p>In the spare room there was a very large toilet-table.
It was hung all round with pink chintz with thin white
muslin over it. When you got under the table the
world was shut out by these curtains, and the light
came through them in a holy, pink, subdued glow. It
was a charming and secluded spot, and here Miss Rose
had placed all ready two small coloured candles and a
box of matches, and the lid of a box piled high with
rose petals, and the green leaf essential to the opening
of the temple. All agreed that it really was as splendid
as she had said. A conference was held, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
ritual decided. The candles were lighted, and placed
one on each side of the temple. The green leaf was
waved, the temple opened, and the magic rings taken
out. At this point the musical-box was to begin to
play. The Priestess had assigned the turning of the
musical-box to Two, because, after all, it was her own
musical-box, and she had so few privileges. So Two
was radiant. The magic rings were to be covered
over with the rose petals, left there until the music
ceased, and then replaced in the temple. Then everybody
was to say, "O magic rings!" three times, and
the candles were to be extinguished. The programme
was never concluded, because, in the middle of it,
Rose's governess, Miss Stagg, came and caught them.</p>

<p>It was Miss Stagg's opinion that they were very
naughty, wicked, irreverent children, and that they
ran a risk of burning the house down. The first accusation
was untrue, but the latter had something in it.</p>

<p>The four children wandered out into the garden, a
dejected group. Cecilia was the only one who had
actually cried though, and they had all comforted
her as well as they could.</p>

<p>"I do hate Miss Stagg," said Rose. "This is the
end of the magic rings."</p>

<p>Netta, the make-believer, rose to the occasion with
a new myth.</p>

<p>"The magic rings have been insulted. They do
not like that. I don't like being insulted myself, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
if it had been <i>my</i> governess I should have answered
back. Well, I know what the magic rings will do now."</p>

<p>"What?"&mdash;breathlessly, from all.</p>

<p>"They will go away. To-night I shall put them in
their temple in their usual place. But to-morrow all of
you come in the morning after lessons, and you'll see&mdash;they'll
be gone! They will go right away by themselves,
perhaps to the moon and perhaps to the Star
of Dolls."</p>

<p>Miss Stagg thought it her duty to inform Mrs
Heritage, who heard the story gravely, and thanked
her, but repeated it brilliantly, amid a good deal of
merriment, to the make-believer's father, when she
dined at his house that night.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, "I must manage a mysterious
disappearance for those rings."</p>

<p>When next morning Netta and her companions
opened the temple the rings were not there, but in
their place was a slip of paper, on which the word
"Good-bye" was written. Not one of the four was
more astonished than Netta herself. "It's really
happened. I wasn't <i>sure</i> it would, you know."</p>

<p>"I shall tell Miss Stagg," said Rose, triumphantly.</p>

<p>"I wonder if we really were wicked," said Cecilia,
with a troubled look in her angel-eyes. "I didn't
mean to be."</p>

<p>They never solved the mystery; gradually they
forgot it.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Part II.&mdash;Further off from Heaven</span></h3>

<p>Forty years passed, and but two of the people of this
story were left alive&mdash;Rose Heritage and Netta.
Rose Heritage had become Lady Mallard, lived in a
big house in the country, and had a grown-up family.
Netta lived alone in a small house in West Kensington.
The two never corresponded, and heard nothing
of each other now. The friendship had never been
violently broken off. It had perished from time and
separation, as friendships will.</p>

<p>Of the others, Cecilia was the first to die. As a
child her nurses had said that she was too good to
live. As a girl of eighteen she seemed too beautiful
to live. It was a beauty so spiritual, so unearthly,
that to see it was to feel that it was claimed elsewhere.
Netta's father had died with the complaint on his
lips that physical pain had so far destroyed his sense
of humour that he got no more pleasure out of leading
articles. Jimmy had gone into the army, spent his
own share of his father's property and most of Netta's,
and finally redeemed by a gallant death a life that
had been remarkably extravagant and bad.</p>

<p>Netta's hair was grey; her face was worn and
ascetic. But one would have said rightly that she
must have been a handsome woman in her time.
She had never married. At seventeen she had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
in love with a man whom she could not marry, a
hopeless affair, and horrible enough for her while it
lasted. It lasted three years. It was all forgotten
now, or only the vague memory of a bad dream.
Jimmy had been a care to her, too; she never knew
while he lived what might not be the next news that
she would hear of him. She had become a learned,
lonely woman now, had taken the degree of doctor of
medicine, practised a little, and wrote very often.
She wrote mostly on her own special subject, but
occasionally for less technical and more widely-read
journals.</p>

<p>She had been writing for one of them, this afternoon,
in her poorly-furnished study upstairs. It was
growing dark, and her reading-lamp by her side was
lit; but she had not yet had the curtains drawn, and
through the windows she could see the white snow
falling slowly into the dirty street. She had stopped
writing in the middle of a sentence:</p>

<p>"And, whether the sentimentalist&mdash;"</p>

<p>She had flung down her pen impatiently. She had
been teased all day by an effort to remember something&mdash;to
explain what was after all a perfectly trivial thing.
In turning over a cupboardful of papers, which had
belonged to her father and been left practically untouched
ever since they had been sent to her house,
she had come across three old curtain rings carefully
tied together. A label was attached to them, and on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
it was written&mdash;the ink was faded and yellow&mdash;"Netta,
the Make-Believer." Underneath were a
few words of Greek. She remembered vaguely that
when she was a child there was something about
curtain-rings&mdash;she had played with them, possibly.
But if that was all, why had her father thought it
worth while to keep them? What was it exactly that
she used to do with those rings?</p>

<p>These silly questions would keep coming into her
head and distracting her attention from her work.
She shivered a little&mdash;the room was chilly&mdash;and took
up her pen again. She wrote:</p>

<p>"And, whether the sentimentalist believes it or
whether he does not, this religious passion which he
admires so vastly in his nuns and martyrs is but a
perversion of an instinct which&mdash;"</p>

<p>Once more she paused. The room was really too
cold. Looking round, she saw that the fire was almost
out. She was accustomed to do things for herself,
and she set to work to revive it at once. She opened
the cupboard where she generally kept a few sticks for
the purpose, but this afternoon there was none there.
The curtain-rings lay on her writing-table, still tied
together. Why, of course, they would do as well.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the fire was blazing brightly
She warmed her hands at it, gazing abstractedly into
the red embers. Then she went back to her work
and wrote rapidly until the article was finished.</p>

<h2>THE UNSEEN POWER</h2>


<p>Winter walked restlessly about the room as he
told his story. He was a slender young man,
with very smooth hair worn rather too long, a gold-mounted
pince-nez, and an expression which showed
that vanity was not wholly absent from his composition.
It was the story of a haunted house. The
man who owned it, and was now unable to let it, had
asked Winter to investigate.</p>

<p>"And the whole point of it is that you've got to
come along and help me," he concluded.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Mr Arden, "but I will not
go."</p>

<p>Arden was a man of fifty, white-haired, thin,
heavily lined.</p>

<p>"Well, why not?" said Winter, peevishly. "I
want to know why not. It seems to me it would be
rather interesting. You can choose any night you
like, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Arden waved the subject away with one hand.
"It's useless to talk about it," he said, "I'm not
going."</p>

<p>"But what do you mean?" said Winter. "You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
are not going to tell me that you're superstitious or
afraid?"</p>

<p>"I should say," said Arden, "that I am what you
would call superstitious. You, I presume, are not."</p>

<p>"Emphatically not," said Winter.</p>

<p>"Nor afraid?"</p>

<p>"Nor afraid," Winter echoed.</p>

<p>"Then why don't you go alone?" said Arden.</p>

<p>Winter murmured of sociability; it was no great
fun to sit up all night by one's self. Besides, in the
detection of a practical joke, which was probably all
that it was, two would be better than one. Arden
must see for himself that&mdash;</p>

<p>Arden broke in impetuously. "Look here," he
said. "Stop wandering about the room and sit
down. I'll tell you why I won't come. Did you
ever hear of Minnerton Priory?"</p>

<p>"Of course I've heard about it. I don't know the
whole story, and I don't suppose anybody does. A
man lost his life over it, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"Two men lost their lives. I was the third man.
Now, you know why I won't play with these things
any more."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it," said Winter. "I've only
heard scraps here and there, and reports are always
inaccurate. So you were actually one of them. I
should never have guessed it."</p>

<p>"I will tell you the story if you wish. Will you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
have it now, or will you wait till you have finished
your investigation of the house at Falmouth?"</p>

<p>"I will hear it now," said Winter.</p>

<p>This is the story that Arden told.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"In 1871 my aunt, Lady Wytham, bought Minnerton
Priory. The place had been uninhabited for the
best part of half a century, and was in very bad repair.
It was cheap and it was picturesque, and both cheapness
and picturesqueness appealed to Lady Wytham.
Of the original Priory there was very little left standing.
Frequent additions had been made to it at
different periods, and the general effect of the place
when I first saw it was rather grim and queer. Lady
Wytham was very energetic, had the place surveyed,
and in a few months had got her workmen down there.
In one wing of the house a secret chamber had been
found. It was on the ground floor, and it was a
small room of perhaps twelve feet square. There
was one window to it, placed very high up, and this
window had been built up on the outside. Opposite
to the window was a small fireplace, and the only
entrance to the room was from the big dining-hall.
The hall was panelled, and one of the panels formed
the door into the secret chamber. I believe this kind
of thing is fairly common in old houses dating back
to the times of religious and political trouble, when
hiding-places were constantly wanted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>"The builders had not been at work many months
at the Priory before there was trouble. I cannot say
exactly what it was. It began with the unbricking
of the little window in the secret chamber. I know
that the men refused point-blank to do any work
whatever in the great dining-hall. Many were dismissed
and new hands were taken on, but the trouble
still persisted, till finally Lady Wytham herself went
down to interview the clerk of works and a foreman
or two. On the following day she wrote to me. She
said that an idiotic story was being told with reference
to the newly-discovered chamber of Minnerton
Priory, and she was anxious to have it satisfactorily
knocked on the head. Would I, and any friends
that I might care to bring down, spend a few nights
in the secret chamber? It would probably be very
uncomfortable, but she would send over furniture
and a servant to wait on us. The postscript explained
that the servant would not sleep in the house.</p>

<p>"The idea rather appealed to me, but being,
unlike yourself, a little nervous over the business, I
determined to take a couple of men down with me.
One of them was an intimate friend of mine, Charles
Stavold, a good-natured giant, but a useful man in a
row. He and I talked it over together, and finally
selected as the third man a young doctor, Bernard
Ash. Ash was a remarkably brilliant young man,
and we looked to him to supply the brains of the trio.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
If any practical joke were attempted he would be
quite certain to find it out, and both Stavold and
myself were quite sure that some practical joke
would be attempted. Minnerton Priory lies in a very
conservative county. The rustics of the village were
quite capable of resenting Lady Wytham's intrusion
into the Priory. It had always been uninhabited in
their father's time, and that would be quite reason
enough to determine them that it should not be inhabited
now. There were some objections to our
choice. Ash led an extremely dissipated life, and
Stavold and myself were a little inclined to doubt his
nerves. This doubt, by the way, was not justified
by results.</p>

<p>"We reached Minnerton in the afternoon. A large
staff of men was busy at work at the place, but the
only person in or anywhere near the great dining-hall
was Lady Wytham's servant, Rudd. She could not
have sent us a better man. He could turn his hand
to anything. He had already unpacked the beds and
other furniture that had been sent and put them in
place, and was at present engaged on getting dinner
for us. We went through the dining-hall and into
the secret chamber.</p>

<p>"'This won't do,' said Ash at once.</p>

<p>"'What don't do?' asked Stavold.</p>

<p>"'Why, there's no furniture in here of any kind.
One can't sleep on these stone flags.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Are we going to sleep in here?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'One of us is,' he said.</p>

<p>"I called up Rudd and gave my directions. He
brought mattresses and made up a bed on the floor.
Then we went round and examined the walls carefully,
for, as Ash observed, where there is one trick
panel there may be another. But we could find
nothing that seemed in any way suspicious.</p>

<p>"We came back into the great hall, and sat down
there and talked the thing over. It was now growing
dusk. Already the tapping and hammering of the
workmen had ceased, and we had heard them laughing
as they passed the window on their way home.
Right away at the other end of the hall came the
chink of plates and the hiss of a frying-pan where
Rudd was busy with his preparations. He had
brought four big lamps with him, and these he now
lit, but there seemed to be something impenetrable
about the darkness of this vast room. The light was
still dim, with masses of dark shadow waving in the
far corners and in the vaulted roof above us.</p>

<p>"'Who's going to sleep in the haunted chamber?'
Stavold asked.</p>

<p>"'I am,' said Ash.</p>

<p>"We squabbled about it, and finally decided to
toss for it. Ash had his own way. He was to sleep
there that night, Stavold was to sleep there the second
night, and I myself was left the third night. By this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
time we had little doubt that we should be at the
bottom of the mystery.</p>

<p>"Rudd gave us an excellent dinner, and had shown
wisdom in his choice of the wine which he had brought
with him. The wine made glad the heart of man,
and before dinner was over we were treating the
whole thing more as an amusing kind of spree than
as a serious investigation. At ten o'clock Rudd inquired
at what hour we should like breakfast in the
morning, and asked if there was anything further he
could do for us that night.</p>

<p>"'Aren't you going to stop and see the ghost,
Rudd?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'I think not, sir,' he said quietly. 'Her ladyship
had arranged, sir, that I should sleep at the
inn.'</p>

<p>"So we let him go, and I had a curious feeling that
with him went the most competent man of the four.
Perhaps the same idea had occurred to Ash.</p>

<p>"'He's a perfect wonder,' said Ash. 'Fancy
being able to turn out a dinner like that here, with no
proper appliances of any kind. I don't call it cooking;
I call it conjuring tricks.'</p>

<p>"'Perhaps you'll see some more conjuring tricks a
little later,' said Stavold, grimly.</p>

<p>"After dinner we played poker for an hour or so
and then turned in. One of the lamps was left burning
in the big hall, and Ash took a candle with him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
into the secret chamber. But he did not propose to
leave it lighted. It wouldn't be playing the game, he
said.</p>

<p>"Some time after I had got into bed I could hear
Ash tapping on the panels and trying them again,
and I could see the light under the door. Stavold
was already heavily sleeping. I knew nothing more
till I was awakened by him early on the following
morning. Rudd had already returned, and was preparing
breakfast. Naturally our first move was to the
secret chamber. We opened the panel door and went
in. Ash's clothes were lying on the only chair in the
room. The bed had been slept in, but there was no
one there now. I noticed that the two candlesticks
had also vanished. For a moment or two neither
of us spoke, and then I asked my companion what
he made of it.</p>

<p>"'That's all right,' he said, 'Ash woke early,
and has slipped down to the river in his pyjamas to
get a swim. It's ten to one we find him there.'</p>

<p>"It was not impossible, but I was surprised that he
had not awakened either of us in passing through the
hall. We picked up our towels and went down to the
river. We called and got no answer, but we had not
at this time begun to be anxious. Possibly after his
bath he had gone off for a stroll through the plantations.
We took a long swim, lit our pipes, and walked
up to the house. The workmen were busy now on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
new part far away from the big hall. In the hall itself
we found breakfast laid for three.</p>

<p>"'Dr Ash has come back then?' I said to
Rudd.</p>

<p>"Rudd looked puzzled. 'I have not seen him
this morning, sir.'</p>

<p>"'Drowned himself?' I suggested to Stavold.</p>

<p>"'Not a bit of it. Why should he? This is a
little practical joke of Ash's. We'll see if he doesn't
get tired of it before we do. Hunger will bring him
back at lunch-time.'</p>

<p>"Late in the afternoon he had not returned, and
we sent word up to the police-station. The police-station
sent us the usual idiot, who made his notes
and did his best to look as if he knew what to do. We
spent the rest of the day in searching for Ash with no
success. At ten o'clock we gave it up, and Rudd
went back to the inn. We did very little talking,
and I had some curious and inexplicable feelings as I
sat there in the silence. My tobacco pouch lay on
the table at arm's length, and I found myself thinking
that I might have an impulse to take it up in my hand
but that as I did not want the pouch at the moment
I should resist the impulse. Then my hand shot right
out to the pouch, gripped it, and shook it.</p>

<p>"'What the devil are you doing?' said Stavold.</p>

<p>"I flung the pouch down and got up from my chair.
'Dropping off to sleep, I fancy,' I said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>"'You didn't look it.'</p>

<p>"'Well, I ought to know, oughtn't I? Help me to
drag another bed into that chamber there. We'll see
it through together to-night.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, no, we won't,' said my companion. 'If
we did that we should leave this hall here for the
use of the practical jokers, if there are any. You will
sleep here to-night. I shall take my turn in the
secret chamber; only, if I can help it, I shan't
sleep.'</p>

<p>"'I wonder where on earth Ash is,' I said.</p>

<p>"'We don't know and it won't improve our nerves
to imagine. Yours seem a bit jumpy anyhow.
We've done all we can to find him. Leave it at
that.'</p>

<p>"I did not expect to sleep that night, yet sleep
came to me in fits. I had wakened many times, and
at last I determined that I might as well get up. In
half an hour the grey dawn would be beginning. I
remembered that Stavold had told me that he did not
mean to go to sleep. I whistled softly as I slipped on
my clothes, so that he might hear that I was moving
about and join me. As he did not come I listened at
the door of the chamber and heard no sound. In a
moment I was standing inside it with the lamp shaking
in my hand. The room was exactly as we had
found it the morning before. There was nobody
there. The bed had been slept in, and was now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
empty. The clothes lay on the chair. The candlestick
had gone. I was horribly frightened.</p>

<p>"I did not wait for Rudd to come back. I went
on to the village police-station at once and told my
story. There was no doubt that this was a serious
matter, and before breakfast-time an inspector had
arrived from Saltham. Accompanied by a serjeant
and myself he came over to the Priory and into the
dining-hall.</p>

<p>"'I think I'll take a look round by myself first,'
he said. 'You can wait here.' He went into the
chamber, and I could hear his heavy boots on the
flags and the useless tapping on the walls. I
was confident that nothing could be found there.
There were a few minutes of silence, and he
opened the door and said, 'Will you come in here,
Mr Arden?'</p>

<p>"I went in and saw that the bed had been
pulled out from its usual place in the corner.
He pointed to a large flagstone which the bed had
covered.</p>

<p>"'I should like to show you, sir, a curious optical
effect there is in this room. Would you mind standing
on that flagstone there?'</p>

<p>"I came round the bed to it, and my foot had just
touched it when I was jerked backwards and fell to
the floor.</p>

<p>"'Beg your pardon, sir,' said the inspector behind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
me. 'I had to satisfy myself that you didn't know
of the trap. See here.'</p>

<p>"He knelt down beside the big flagstone and
touched it lightly with his fingers. It was exactly
balanced by a big iron pin through the centre, and it
now swung open, showing a dark shaft going far down
into the earth.</p>

<p>"'You mean that they are down there?' I said.</p>

<p>"'Not a doubt. Each of them, as is only natural,
tried the floor as well as the walls, and moved the
bed for the purpose. That finished them. It's
the merest chance that I didn't go down the shaft
myself.'</p>

<p>"'Well,' I said, 'the sooner we go down there the
better. Where can we get a rope?'</p>

<p>"The inspector picked up a small tin match-box
and emptied out the matches into the palm of his
hand. 'Listen,' he said. He flung the box down
the shaft. We listened, and listened, but heard no
sound. 'See?' he said. 'That's deep. No use
to get a rope there. Anyone who fell down there is
dead. That's been a well, I should say.'</p>

<p>"I was angry with the man's cock-surety, and said
that I was going down in any case. A rope was
brought and attached to a lighted lantern. The
lantern was lowered, and in a few yards went out.
The experiment was tried again and again, and each
time the lantern was extinguished by the foul air.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
It was hopeless. No human being could have lived
for five minutes down there.</p>

<p>"I rose from the floor, put on my coat, and turned
to the inspector. 'This explains nothing,' I said.
'On the morning that Dr Ash was missed I went in
here with Mr Stavold, and we found the bed placed
as it had been the night before, immediately over this
trap. If Dr Ash fell down it how did he put the bed
back after him? The same thing applies to Mr
Stavold; again the bed was left over the trap.'</p>

<p>"'They did not move the bed back again, but
somebody else did.'</p>

<p>"'Who?'</p>

<p>"'That is what I hope to find out to-night? Are
you yourself willing to sleep to-night in the big hall
alone?'</p>

<p>"'Certainly. I don't exactly see what the
idea is.'</p>

<p>"'Never mind about that. It may come to nothing.
One can but try. You say that Rudd locked
the door to this hall when he went out at night?'</p>

<p>"'Yes. A modern lock had been fitted, and the
door locked itself as soon as it was shut. It could
only be opened from the outside with a latch-key.'</p>

<p>"'And no one but yourself, that you know of, had
a key?'</p>

<p>"'No one that I know of.'</p>

<p>"'Very well. I have a few things to see after. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
must speak to this man Rudd. I shall see you again
before nightfall.'</p>

<p>"I spent a horribly long day. I had to telegraph
to the relatives of my two friends. I sent Rudd for
books, and tried in vain to read. Rudd was aware
that the police had a suspicious eye upon him and was
in a state of suppressed fury. While Rudd was away
I again examined the inner chamber. The window
was too high up to be reached by anyone within the
room, and too closely barred to admit of anyone passing
through it. The chimney was equally impassable.
No vestige of hope was left to me. At ten o'clock
the inspector came in and told me that he had given
up for the night. He looked thoughtfully towards
the whisky decanter. I gave him a drink and mixed
one for myself. Then he said good-night and went
off.</p>

<p>"I had not expected to sleep, but an insurmountable
drowsiness came over me. I flung myself down
on the bed as I was, without undressing, hoping that
in this way I should wake again in an hour or so.</p>

<p>"When I woke the room was brightly lighted.
The inspector, two of his men, and Rudd himself were
all there. I was startled.</p>

<p>"'What's the matter? What's up?' I said.</p>

<p>"'Nothing much,' said the inspector, 'but I know
who put the bed back in its place.'</p>

<p>"'Who was it?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>"'It was yourself, sir. You did it in your sleep.
It had occurred to me that this was just possible, and
I had a man watching through the window of the
room.'</p>

<p>"'It is impossible,' I said. 'I should know something
of it. I am sure I have been here ever since
you left me. Your man must have made a mistake.'</p>

<p>"'My man made no mistake,' said the inspector,
drily, 'for my man happened to be myself. You
came in, set the lamp down, pushed the bed over to
one corner, and then went to the chair, where you
seemed to be folding up imaginary clothes.'</p>

<p>"The bodies were recovered two days later, and
the whole story of course got into the papers. I was
away from England for some years after that. It was
one of the things that one wishes to forget. You ask
me to take part in another of these investigations.
In all probability there is nothing to investigate but
a practical joke, or a chance noise, or something
equally explicable, but you will understand that I
will not take the risk that there may be something
else."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"But, my dear Arden," said Winter, balancing the
pince-nez in his hand, "there is nothing whatever in
the story that you have told me. What could be
more natural than that your two friends should examine
the floor, should do so with too little care, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
should reap the consequences? The repeated dream
is itself quite natural; I should imagine there are few
people who have not had it. At the most it is a
coincidence that the dream, accompanied by somnambulism,
should have come three nights in succession,
but there is nothing supernatural there."</p>

<p>"Never mind that word supernatural. Do you
think there is anything inexplicable? You are forgetting
that the bed in that chamber had been slept
in both nights. The sleeper had been awakened by
some sound. What was it? What drew him to the
trap-door? What was it that took possession of my
will and my body so that my own personality was as
blotted out as if I had been dead? But," he added,
impatiently, "I do not want to convince you. When
you are brought in touch, as I have been, with the
unseen power you will be convinced. As your
friend, I hope you never will be."</p>

<h2>A BRISK ENGAGEMENT</h2>


<p>He stepped out of the fashionable bazaar into the
crowded street, where the July sun flashed on
the ugly and beautiful and on the grey background.
He was a young man with the face of a dreamer, but
his hair was properly cut and he was as well and
cleanly turned out as if he had been a soldier. He
wore in his buttonhole a red rose; it was not his
habit to decorate himself florally, but these things
happen at bazaars; some pretty fool-girl had sold it
to him. And Lady Mabel Silverton, who is not
pretty but a dear sweet creature, had sold him iced
coffee and drunk it for him&mdash;she would do anything
for a charity&mdash;and bothered him to come and sing
one Saturday night to her darling factory-girls, who
would be so very, very grateful. The hum of many
nicely-toned voices and the passionate waltz of the
Mauve Hungarians still blended and swam in his
ears. He still seemed to smell the scent of the
smouldering incense sticks on the stall where Mrs
Bunningham Smythe, clad in an Oriental robe of
thoroughly Western impropriety, sold penny "Turkish
Amulets" at ten shillings apiece to those young men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
who were sufficiently fond of her for the purpose.
He was stupid with it all. He left it, and the long
string of carriages at the doors, and wandered out
into the Park. And he chose the more deserted part
of the Park.</p>

<p>Yes, it was no worse than anything else, as his
cousin had said when she had bothered him into
going. But the young man was mildly, temporarily,
and uncomplainingly bored with most things. There
was too much sugar in the cup; he found the taste
sickly. This London world in which he lived was too
luxurious, too idle, and worked too hard at being too
idle. He was weary of the mechanical metallic
frivolity of smart people, frivolity without one touch
of sincerity and earnestness to give it contrast and
effect. It was the end of the season, and he would
soon be away in the country&mdash;only to find London in
the country. There would be the same people with
the same bad habits, merely transplanted to a scene
which did not suit them.</p>

<p>He stood still and looked around him. There was
a man with a crowd before him in the distance by the
Marble Arch; he waved his arms and lectured
violently. Children chased one another across the
grass. Down the path towards him came a girl who
held herself well. A tramp under the trees roused
himself from slumber, and began slowly and painfully
to put on his boots. And the young man thought it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
would make the very pleasantest holiday if he could
change with somebody&mdash;even with the tramp under
the trees for a few hours and get rid of himself. He
chanced to remember that rose in his coat, and did not
like it. He raised his hand to take it out. And the
girl whose graceful carriage he had noticed stepped
shyly up to him.</p>

<p>"It is you then? It must be," she said, in rather
a frightened voice.</p>

<p>In a flash he saw that the girl mistook him for
somebody else, and&mdash;since chance willed it&mdash;decided
to be for a while that somebody.</p>

<p>"Certainly, it is," he said. "I do hope I have not
kept you waiting."</p>

<p>This was more interesting than private theatricals.
But even as he spoke it struck him that it would be
easier if he knew who he was supposed to be.</p>

<p>She was charming, he thought, and not foolish;
the face was full of life and expression. He
noted that she looked at him and away from
him in quick flashes, as if trying to hide a surprised
curiosity.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I have only just come. I think
we are both a few minutes before the time."</p>

<p>"You did not seem quite&mdash;well, quite sure of it
when you recognised me."</p>

<p>She laughed, showing her pretty teeth. "You did
not seem to be looking out for me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was&mdash;but in the wrong direction."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course you didn't know which way I
should come. And then I thought you looked rather
too splendid for a solicitor's clerk. You don't mind
my saying that?" she added rapidly.</p>

<p>(So he was a solicitor's clerk in his new impersonation;
this was useful information.) "Not in the
least. We put on our nicest clothes for these occasions.
My firm expects me to keep one good suit&mdash;to wear
when I have to go and see wealthy and important
clients&mdash;to&mdash;er&mdash;take their instructions." (He felt
that this was a happy touch; he was falling quite
easily into his part). "And, if I may say so, that
must be quite your prettiest dress."</p>

<p>She glanced downward at it. She raised her eyebrows,
and there was a quaint prettiness in the wilful
twist of her lips. She seemed perplexed. "I don't
think so," she said.</p>

<p>"And what made you decide that it was really I?"</p>

<p>"You were standing there just at the spot we arranged,
and just at the time we arranged. You were
wearing the red rose, and you raised your hand as if to
call my attention to it. It was beyond mistake. But
why did you say in your letter that you were of
medium height? You are tall."</p>

<p>"Slightly over medium height, perhaps. I should
hardly say tall."</p>

<p>"In many ways you are not what I expected.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
These preconceived ideas of people are always wrong.
But indeed you don't look the part at all."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"No," she said. "I should have taken you for
a man of leisure&mdash;wealthy&mdash;rather bored with
life&mdash;clever perhaps&mdash;certainly selfish." And she
would have taken him for very much what he
was.</p>

<p>"I will plead guilty to the last item. And now,
what shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Do? Just as we arranged of course. We can
stroll through the Park for half an hour&mdash;talk&mdash;make
each other's acquaintance. And then I shall
see if in any way I can help you in your work and
make your life happier."</p>

<p>"Suppose," said the young man, "we change the
programme a little. Let me take you down to Bond
Street and give you some tea there."</p>

<p>The look of surprise became almost suspicion. She
hesitated for a moment. "Very well," she said.
"That will be charming."</p>

<p>They had reached the Park gate. The young man
stopped a hansom and they got in.</p>

<p>"You are extravagant," she said. "We might
have taken a 'bus or the Tube. We might even have
walked."</p>

<p>The young man reminded himself that he was now
a solicitor's clerk. "True," he said. "But it is only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
a shilling fare. And Saturday afternoon is our holiday,
you know."</p>

<p>"I shall insist on paying half the cab and half
everything."</p>

<p>"That must be just as you wish. But if you do it
will be a disappointment for me. And it is really
not a very serious matter, even for me."</p>

<p>She seemed to think this over. Lady Mabel met
them in her victoria, and the young man saluted her.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the girl, suddenly. "I won't
pay for anything at all."</p>

<p>"Thanks so much," said the young man.</p>

<p>"But all of this," said the girl, much as if she had
been speaking to herself, "is not in the least like what
I had expected."</p>

<p>At the shop in Bond Street he took her upstairs to
a table in a secluded corner.</p>

<p>"You seem to know your way about this place,"
she said, as she unbuttoned her gloves.</p>

<p>"I was here once on business. And I never
forget places."</p>

<p>"Five times since we left the Park we have met
people that you knew."</p>

<p>"Yes. Queer coincidence, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"And they were all wealthy-looking people."</p>

<p>"Clients," he said dreamily. "All clients."
Then, with an awakening interest, "Will you have
tea or coffee?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tea, please. And they all smiled and bowed to
you just as if they had been your personal friends."</p>

<p>"Well, you know, it's like this. I've had to deal
with them in some very important family matters&mdash;dark
secrets. They possibly have the feeling that it
is better to be on good terms with me&mdash;that I shall
be more careful not to talk about their secrets, you
know."</p>

<p>Even as the young man said it he was aware of the
remarkable feebleness of it. So apparently was the
girl.</p>

<p>"But I thought solicitors never talked about their
clients' business," she said.</p>

<p>"They don't. Of course. Certainly not. But
then I'm not a solicitor; I'm only a clerk. Still, it's
a mistaken feeling; I've often wondered how it gets
to be so common."</p>

<p>The young man felt that the game, though interesting,
was becoming difficult. He reflected that at any
minute people who knew him might come in and
insist on talking to him. And then&mdash;the girl would
discover everything and never forgive him. And the
more he saw of her the more he wanted to be forgiven
when the game came to its end.</p>

<p>He was unable to place her exactly. She was not
a typist. She seemed too educated to be a governess.
It was even more certain that she was not a fashionable
London woman. She might possibly be a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
student of one of the arts. She was a little imperious
in her way, yet she had the kindest and friendliest
eyes. She was transparently good, and he guessed
that unconventionality was unusual with her. She
had not spoiled its effect for herself by making it
commonplace. And who on earth was this solicitor's
clerk whom this charming person had meant to meet,
and why had she been going to meet him? It
occurred to the young man that he would like to
wring the neck of that clerk (whom he was at present
fraudulently under-studying) for his infernal impertinence.</p>

<p>"Now," said the girl, "I want you to tell me why
you wrote in the first instance?"</p>

<p>This was a facer. He chanced it. "But I think
you know," he said; and it turned out very well.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do, more or less. I know you read my
verses, and that you then wrote to me at the office of
the paper and said the kindest things."</p>

<p>The young man shook his head. "They were less
than the truth," he said.</p>

<p>"But, after all, the idea in the verses&mdash;the kindred
souls that Fate keeps strangers to each other&mdash;that's
not a new idea. You must have seen something
of the kind scores of times before."</p>

<p>"If I had seen it before I did not remember it. I
certainly had not seen it treated in that way. Your
poem seemed to come to me like a message." This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
for a young man who had not read one word of the
poem was distinctly good&mdash;or, if you prefer it, distinctly
bad.</p>

<p>"Well, when you wrote the first letter had you any
idea of writing the second, the one in which you asked
me to meet you?"</p>

<p>"I had to see how you would take it. I know it
was great presumption on my part to hope for
anything of the kind; it was most good of you
to come."</p>

<p>"I wondered how long it would be before you
thanked me."</p>

<p>"A thousand pardons. I see little society, of
course. I am shy and awkward. I never say the
right thing."</p>

<p>"But you are not shy and awkward. You are not
at all what I expected. I have your second letter
here. Listen. I leave out the part where you speak
of your loneliness."</p>

<p>"There are few lives," said the young man, sorrowfully,
"more solitary than that of a solicitor's clerk.
You don't know." Nor, for that matter, did he.</p>

<p>"Then the letter goes on: 'If you could make it
convenient to spare me a few moments of your
valuable time&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Did I really say that?"</p>

<p>"Of course you did. Here it is."</p>

<p>"These business forms ring in one's head. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
get into one's blood. One uses them unconsciously
and inelegantly."</p>

<p>"I will read on: 'If you could make it convenient
to spare me a few moments of your valuable time I
should like to have a go at telling you my story.
Sympathy in my case has generally been conspicuous
by its absence, but I think I could depend on the
author of "The Strangers." I am rather a doleful
sort, I am afraid, but I daresay you don't care for
larking about any more than I do.'"</p>

<p>He had to hear that letter through to the end, and
there was a good deal more of it. He had made himself
responsible for the personality of a man who
described himself as rather a doleful sort, said that he
did not care for larking about, and spoke of a thing
being conspicuous by its absence. And there was not
even the possibility of protest. He had to accept
it. He could not even groan out loud. The
punishment for yielding to sudden impulses was
heavy indeed.</p>

<p>"Now," she went on, "you see what I mean when
I say that you do not at all match with the Samuel
Pepper who wrote that letter."</p>

<p>His name was Samuel Pepper then! It was almost
too much. This, he felt, would be a lifelong lesson to
him. He had to say something. "But," he pleaded,
"few people write and speak in just the same
way."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is not my point. You write to me as a
humble pleader for a favour."</p>

<p>"Naturally."</p>

<p>"When you meet me, you take something very
much like the air of an amused social superior."</p>

<p>"I hope not!" exclaimed the young man with real
sincerity. He struggled mentally after a correct
Samuel Pepper attitude. "It was quite unintentional,
and no disrespect meant. I suppose on a
Saturday out, when I come up West, I get a bit above
myself and my station. But I never meant to presume."
He felt that this had the right Pepperian
touch of humble commonness. "In the office or at
home&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean in the Guildford Street boarding-house?"</p>

<p>"Quite so. It's the only London home I've
got. In the office or at home I'm quite a different
person."</p>

<p>"Oh, please! I don't mention the difference in
manner because I care twopence about it, but to
point out an inconsistency which puzzles me&mdash;perhaps
I should say which did puzzle me at first. And
why have you not told me that story that you wished
me to hear. Why is it that you have not even
referred to it?"</p>

<p>"Ah," said the young man, "how often one gets
to the verge of a confession and then shirks it!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
Believe me, it is not an easy story for me to tell.
Perhaps even it would be better for me to bear my
burden alone."</p>

<p>"Very well. And those poems that you have
written&mdash;you wished to show them to me, to get my
opinion and see if I could help you towards publication."</p>

<p>"My fatal shyness! You, a writer yourself, must
know what that is!" He felt that he was quite lost,
and that the girl was getting angry, and he wished he
could think of some way out of it.</p>

<p>"So I am not to have your verses or your story.
But I think I will trouble you to hear a little of my
story. You are not Samuel Pepper. With my experience
of story-writing I ought to have seen that
that was a make-up name, to suit the part of a
solicitor's clerk. There is no Samuel Pepper. Your
letters then were not genuine. They were very well
done; as an artist I congratulate you. The thing that
puzzles me is that you could not keep it up better
when you had trapped me into meeting you. You
cannot act a bit. You have not even dressed the
part. You have not even taken the trouble to put a
few verses in manuscript in your pocket. I will tell
you why you succeeded in deceiving me in your
letters. I live with my family, and I write stories and
verses. I know they are not very good, but the
money that I get for them is a consideration, and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
hope with practice to do better. You touched my
vanity, it is not often that anybody takes any notice
of my work. And you appealed to my compassion.
That part of your letter where you spoke of your
loneliness among the people at the boarding-house
seemed to me to be quite simple and unaffected. It
made some impression on me. I was interested in
what you said about your writing, and I remembered
what a struggle I had at first myself; I thought I
could help you. I felt safe because I trusted to your
timidity and your sense of the difference between us,
so cleverly conveyed in your letters. That was why
you were able to trap me; and it will teach me in
future not to be vain or kind-hearted. I don't know
why you wanted to do it. You have had your joke,
perhaps, or you have won your bet. You won't make
the mistake of supposing that you have made my acquaintance,
or of writing to me again. Now, I am
going."</p>

<p>So that was it; she had taken a firm feminine intelligent
grasp of the wrong end of the stick. She
had also caught up her gloves. Her eyes were filled
with tears of rage, and he felt very bad indeed. If he
had asked her to stop she would have hurried away
all the quicker; he could see that.</p>

<p>"Our meeting was a chance one," he said. "I
know nothing of Pepper or his letters except what
you have told me. You mistook me for the man you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
were going to meet. I am sorry I did not correct
your mistake since it has pained you. Otherwise I
should have been very glad of it."</p>

<p>She sat down again, bewildered. "Chance?" she
said.</p>

<p>"Pure chance. I shouldn't like to say much for
my taste this afternoon, but really I don't make bets
or jokes of that kind. I was at a silly bazaar in Hill
Street this afternoon for a few minutes, and some idiot
sold me this rose. I don't wear flowers, and I was on
the point of taking it out of my coat when you spoke
to me. The other man probably arrived after we had
gone; you remember you said that we were a few
minutes before the time."</p>

<p>The girl leaned her elbow on the table and her head
on her hand and looked at him intently. "It is too
amazing," she said. "I think you are telling me the
truth now. But how am I to know? You have not
behaved well. You have deceived me." There were
perplexed pauses between her sentences.</p>

<p>"I tried to deceive you, with the intention of undeceiving
you in the end. You must own that I
failed and that the humiliation is mine. But it is
true that I have behaved badly; and it is true that
I am sorry for it."</p>

<p>"Why did you do it? I can't think why."</p>

<p>"Do you remember your first impression of me?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am not clever, but in other respects you were
about right. I was tired of everything and particularly
tired of myself. It was a sudden whim. I
began it in order to get away from myself."</p>

<p>"But why did you go on with it?"</p>

<p>"I went on with it to be with you."</p>

<p>She looked away from him, and there was a quick
flush of colour in her cheeks. "Anyhow," she said,
"the mistake is at an end now. I must be going."
But she did not speak very resolutely.</p>

<p>"Will you forgive me before you go?"</p>

<p>"Why should I forgive you?"</p>

<p>"Because," said the young man, with some
audacity, "I have done you a very great service."</p>

<p>Her eyebrows were interrogative.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have stopped you from meeting this Pepper
person. I know your motives. I don't believe in the
vanity at all. It is natural to be pleased when one's
work is praised; I'm always pleased if anybody likes
my music. I do believe that you were actuated solely
by your kindness of heart and nothing else. But you
were doing an indiscreet thing, and I feel sure from his
letters that this man would have misunderstood it.
Even if he had not shown presumption in his manner
to you, I am sure he would have talked you over afterwards
at his disgusting boarding-house and with his
fellow-clerks. Why did he propose a meeting at all?
Why could he not have submitted his doggerel to you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
by post, if you were kind enough to look at it for
him? Why did he suggest this red rose nonsense if
he had not got some romantic ideas in his stupid
head? The man's impertinence simply staggers
me."</p>

<p>She smiled a little. "You are right perhaps. It
was indiscreet. But you are too hard on him."</p>

<p>"I don't think so. I want you to promise me you
will not meet him. You can write and say that you
have changed your mind; he can post his verses to
you, if you want to let him down easily."</p>

<p>"Very well. I think that would be best, though
I don't know why I should promise you. Good-bye."</p>

<p>"Already?"</p>

<p>"I live away at Surbiton. I have a train to
catch."</p>

<p>"Am I forgiven?"</p>

<p>"Yes; quite."</p>

<p>"Then let me at least take you as far as Waterloo."</p>

<p>She said nothing. But they went to Waterloo together,
and in the cab they explained quite a number
of things about themselves to each other. He also
got into the train with her, and they had the carriage
to themselves. And there he told her that he loved
her and wished to marry her, and he did it far more
beautifully than a bare record of the facts can
suggest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>She tried to speak three times and failed. So he
understood her perfectly.</p>

<p>And some few minuter after they had exchanged
their hearts' love, they also exchanged their names
and addresses.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Lady Mabel Silverton says that it is a perfectly
ideal marriage. The world thinks that he might have
done much better for himself. He is inclined to
agree with Lady Mabel. His wife would say that she
agreed with the world; but I should doubt her
sincerity.</p>

<h2>HASHEESH</h2>

<h4>I</h4>


<p>The season was nearly at its end. On the terrace
of Shepherd's were many groups, German,
American and English, stopping for a few days in
Cairo on their way home. In the street in front of
the terrace the hawkers displayed their wares&mdash;panpipes,
fly-whisks, images of the Sphinx, picture post-cards,
matches. One offered for sale an inlaid table
that he carried on his head. Another handed up an
old flint-lock pistol, heavily mounted in silver, for the
inspection of a pretty girl from Cincinnati. Every
now and then a carriage drove up, and a party of
tourists passed up the steps, followed by a dragoman
laden with kodaks, and dust cloaks, and bazaar purchases.
The bright sunlight flooded a scene of
brilliant colours.</p>

<p>At one of the tables&mdash;next to that where the pretty
girl from Cincinnati was sipping her tea&mdash;sat three
men of different ages. Mr Nathaniel Brookes, a man
of some sixty years and rather distinguished appearance,
was discussing total prohibitions with Dr<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
Henson-Blake. The doctor was a man of wiry build,
with the face of a hawk, and that indescribable look
which comes only of strength and experience. The
third man listened and fidgeted. From babyhood he
had been precocious and preferred to associate with
those who were older than he was. In consequence
he sometimes had to sit, as now, rather on the outside
of the association. He smoked endless cigarettes and
drank something which was cold and not good for
him out of a long glass in which the ice tinkled pleasantly.
He was a fair-haired young man whom the
sun had merely freckled. He wore a single eye-glass,
but did not always dare to use it. When you had
got to the bottom of his failings you found fundamentally
by no means a bad sort of man, by name
Percival Lake. This was his first year in Egypt.
Both Brookes and the doctor had known Egypt for
many years.</p>

<p>It was Brookes who was speaking. "The Fellaheen
should be allowed to dig," he said, "and it
should be made well worth their while to dig."</p>

<p>"But they do," said the doctor. "They all of them
do it in the summer, and they always have done."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Brookes. "Prohibitions which are
too strict are always evaded. It's the same thing with
hasheesh. But what I mean is that if we succeed in
stopping the Fellaheen from digging, the working
European Egyptologist will find very little. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
native will take care of that, and this is a case where
the native has knowledge that the European can get
only from him."</p>

<p>"That's possible," the doctor agreed.</p>

<p>"What's that about hasheesh?" the young man
asked. "I thought it was the kind of drug that one
came across frequently in stories, and rarely in
chemist's shops, and nowhere else."</p>

<p>"Nominally," said Brookes, "there is no hasheesh
in Egypt. It is not allowed. It is contraband. I
forget how many tons of it were seized last year, and
I should be sorry to say how much managed to get
through."</p>

<p>"Then the natives really use it?"</p>

<p>"Of course they do. There is a common type in
all races which requires a nerve alterative and will
have it. If religion or sentiment or custom shuts out
alcohol, then it will be opium or hasheesh. Egypt
goes for hasheesh."</p>

<p>"And the prohibition is of no use?" asked Lake.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't say that," Brookes replied grimly.
"If a native has a quarrel with his neighbour, he can&mdash;and
sometimes does&mdash;sow cannabis Indica on his
neighbour's land and then report him for growing
illegal stuff as soon as the crop comes up. That is
useful. Speaking seriously, the prohibition may
lessen the amount of hasheesh consumed, and undoubtedly
has raised its price considerably&mdash;vices<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
are the monopoly of the rich. All the same, I had a
boy working on my dahabeeah last year who was an
excellent fellow. This year he was impossible, and
I had to sack him. That was hasheesh."</p>

<p>"And what is the effect of it?"</p>

<p>"Ask the doctor."</p>

<p>"If you take enough and take it long enough," said
Dr Henson-Blake, "the effect is insanity. The given
percentage in the asylums is fairly high, and should
perhaps be higher. They don't admit that they
smoke hasheesh or have ever smoked it if they can
help it, and it cannot always be spotted."</p>

<p>"But what is the immediate effect?"</p>

<p>"A sense of <i>bien &eacute;tre</i>, of the absence of all worry.
Sometimes there are delusions. The typical smoker
generally gets an excessive vanity&mdash;swelled head&mdash;and
becomes very quarrelsome. That is why
Brookes had to sack that boy of his."</p>

<p>"All the same," said Lake, "I should very much
like to try it."</p>

<p>"If I thought you meant that&mdash;" the doctor began,
with the suspicion of a sneer.</p>

<p>Lake was rather angry. "I can assure you I am
not talking for effect. There are some people who
don't, you know."</p>

<p>"All right," said the doctor, unperturbed.
"Keep your hair on. I've got some tobacco prepared
with hasheesh upstairs. It is some that I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
to confiscate. I'll give you a pipeful and you can try
it after dinner. Smoke it in your own room, though&mdash;not
downstairs."</p>

<p>"Leave it alone," growled Brookes.</p>

<p>"Thanks very much," said Lake to the doctor.
"I'll come up with you now and get it."</p>

<p>The three men rose. As they did so the pretty girl
from Cincinnati stepped up to the doctor.</p>

<p>"Say, doctor&mdash;listen to me. Am I to give that man
five dollars and a half for this?"</p>

<p>The doctor took the scarab in his hand and examined
it.</p>

<p>"No, Miss Jocelyn," he said.</p>

<p>"Why not? I call that a dandy scarab. White
amethyst. Genuine antique."</p>

<p>"It is not white amethyst and I know the man who
made it&mdash;the day before yesterday. If you want it
for a toy, ten piastres is an outside price. The man
will take that."</p>

<p>"My!" exclaimed Miss Jocelyn. "Thank you
vurry much," and she returned to her negotiations.</p>

<p>The three men passed through into the hall.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>After dinner, Brookes and Dr Henson-Blake went
off to see a friend at the Savoy. They left with grim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
half-chaffing injunctions to young Lake to take care
of himself. Lake, a little sulky, settled himself in one
corner of the hall to smoke a cigarette before his
experiment.</p>

<p>And suddenly Miss Jocelyn, whom he did not
know, came up to him.</p>

<p>She was a dark girl, pale-skinned and red-lipped.
She had a little of that jaunty, almost slangy American
air of being able to take care of herself. But
she also carried the impression that this air was superficial,
and underneath it there might be poetry of a
rather volcanic order. She sat down quietly on the
other side of the table, and said:</p>

<p>"Do you not know me, Mr Lake?"</p>

<p>Lake said that at any rate he was charmed to have
the privilege of making her acquaintance.</p>

<p>"But," she went on, "I want you to behave just
as if you had known me for some time. My Aunt
Esmeralda is watching us from away back, and she's
pretty 'cute. Don't smile too much. Offer me a
cigarette or order some coffee for me, as if it were an
ordinary thing that you had often done before for
me. Don't look at me all the time&mdash;look away now
and then. I'll tell you why I'm doing this directly."</p>

<p>Lake did his best to act the part, and to take things
more simply. He was consumed with curiosity, and
for that reason he said, as he lighted her cigarette,
"It is so nice of you to do this&mdash;to take pity on my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
loneliness&mdash;that I feel the reason why does not matter
at all. I am unquestioningly contented with things
as they are."</p>

<p>"I just want to tell you. I know Dr Henson-Blake&mdash;we
were on the tourist boat together. He's
playing it low down on you. That tobacco he gave
you is ordinary tobacco. He wants to make you say
afterwards that you got a lot of funny sensations out
of it, and then he'll say there was no hasheesh in it at
all, and just laugh at you. You needn't ask me how I
know, but it's the truth."</p>

<p>"I believe you. The possibility of it had occurred
to me. Well, I have only to tell him that I got no
sensations at all, and that's all over with this little
joke."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Miss Jocelyn, "but you can get back
on him. That's better."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Spin him a long story. Tell him you smoked it
and it gave you visions. Then when he's finished
with his laugh, give him his tobacco back again to
prove that you knew his game all the time."</p>

<p>"Excellent." He took from his pocket a little
box in which the tobacco was placed, put it in one
of the hotel envelopes and sealed it and dated it.
"But the triumph must be yours," he said.</p>

<p>She leaned forward seriously. "Listen to me.
You don't want to mention my name&mdash;you don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
even know it, but I'm Irene Jocelyn. I've put confidence
in you. See, he's not got to know that I've
had anything to do with it. You promise me
that?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. But I'm puzzled. Why do you
come along to save me from making myself ridiculous?
It's very kind of you. I'm very glad you've done it.
But why?"</p>

<p>She hesitated and blushed slightly. "For myself,
perhaps."</p>

<p>It seemed promising; he was emboldened.
"What a pity I have wasted my time by not meeting
you before? Have you been long in Cairo?"</p>

<p>"A few days," she said absent-mindedly. "My!"
she exclaimed. "If I don't go back to my Aunt
Esmeralda right now, there's going to be a deal of
trouble. I'll say good-night to you, Mr Lake."</p>

<p>He was rather staggered. "Good-night," he said.
"But I hope this is not the last time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It depends. Mind that when he's about you
don't know me."</p>

<p>He watched her as she went up the hall. Her
bright smile came off very easily. She looked a little
tired and hunted.</p>

<p>That night he could come to no satisfactory explanation.
He could only decide to do exactly as he
had been told, and await events. In the meantime
the girl's face haunted him, and always as it had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
when she did not know that he could see her&mdash;always
with that tired and hunted look. What had been
her story? What was inside her heart and mind?
What cards was she playing? Why had she spoken
to him? The questions were endless. His interest
in her, strangely powerful, kept him for long awake.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>The little farce was played out with great success
next morning. Lake told a beautiful story, and did
it the better because Irene Jocelyn, breakfasting alone
at the next table, was listening intently. After smoking
the hasheesh he had heard the Sphinx talking.
Then a black and limitless ocean had broken over it,
and out of the ocean a strange white woman had
crept and cut herself with a gold-handled knife.</p>

<p>"Good," said the doctor, with dry triumph.
"And the more interesting because you have never
had any hasheesh at all."</p>

<p>"No?" asked Lake. "I thought that would be
it." He tossed the envelope across to the doctor.
"You'll find your tobacco inside&mdash;how do you give
it that green colour? I think the score is with me."</p>

<p>The doctor was angry, the more so because Brookes
was undisguisedly amused at the failure. But he
made one shrewd guess. "If I had mentioned the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
thing to a solitary soul I should have been certain
that it had been given away to you. As it is, I can't
see how you came to think of it for yourself. It's
quite unlike you."</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>For the next two days Irene Jocelyn successfully
avoided young Lake, and thereby drove him to the
verge of madness. It even occurred to him to play
a bold stroke and ask the doctor to introduce him.
But he had the reasonable conviction that that introduction
would do him more harm than good
with this strange girl. He grew to hate Henson-Blake;
it was evident that while he was there Irene
would not speak. He invented excuses to get him
out of the way.</p>

<p>On the third day she came up to him in the hall
with hand outstretched. "I just want to say good-bye
to you, Mr Lake," she said. "We leave this
afternoon."</p>

<p>"Won't you tell me anything before you go? I
can find no reason why you should have interested
yourself in my defence. Still less can I find any
reason why you should have avoided me ever
since?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I wasn't interested in you. You're not&mdash;what
do you say?&mdash;not on in this act. Didn't I tell
you that I was doing it for myself?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You are clever&mdash;you found out the doctor's
trick."</p>

<p>"I know him. I told you that I met him on the
tourist boat. I knew what he would do."</p>

<p>"I am stupid&mdash;for I also knew him, and did not
find out. I'm not vain enough, believe me, to suppose
that you did this for love of me."</p>

<p>She laughed and snapped her fingers.</p>

<p>"I wish to God you had!" he added, and the tone
and simplicity of the words carried conviction. She
changed her manner. She became serious.</p>

<p>"What was done, not for love of you, was done for
hate of somebody else! Can't you imagine a woman
wanting to hit back, and too proud to let it be known
that she wants to hit at all? Can't you imagine her
hungering and thirsting to see a certain man fail, if
only in some little thing, just for once? Can't you&mdash;Oh,
you don't want the whole humiliating story, do
you?"</p>

<p>"No, no. I'm sorry. Good-bye."</p>

<p>"Good-bye."</p>

<p>"Only you know&mdash;that is not for hate of a man.
If you hated, there might be a chance for those who
loved."</p>

<p>She shook her head and turned away. A minute<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
later he heard her laughing, and talking her best
American to a group of hotel acquaintances.</p>

<p>And this is perhaps the primary reason why Percival
Lake did ultimately take to hasheesh in sober
earnest. His friends have ceased to speak of him.
Dr Henson-Blake is interested in the case.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE GARDENER</h2>


<p>Seven years to-day have I been in this place, and
I am beginning to ask myself whether it is not
time that I made a move. When I come to think
of it, in my last place I had ten under me, and
here it's but three men and a boy, and I always have
said and always shall say that a boy is worse than
nothing. In some ways I might be sorry to leave.
There is work which I have begun here, and which I
should be sorry to see pass into other hands to be
made a muddle of. Still, as my father used to say,
if you don't respect yourself, nobody is going to
respect you, and I'm in two minds whether I ought
to put up with such language as I had to-day.</p>

<p>"It's all damned carelessness," he said. "You
know how particular I am about those Blenheims,
and I'd sooner have lost anything in the garden. It
isn't because you can't do it. I've always been proud
of my melons before. It's just because you've got
careless and don't care a curse how much you neglect
your work. Most men would have given you the
sack at once, and you shall have it from me if ever I
find anything of this kind again."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>That's what he said. And in one way it's all true
enough. That lot of melons should have been shut
up at the right time, and I've lost 'em in consequence.
But it's the first time I've lost anything like
that all the years I've been here, and I don't know
that I feel inclined to put up with it. Here am I, a
single man of good character. There may be some as
can teach me a little about my business, and I'm
always willing to learn; but I've never found 'em yet.
I can show as good testimonials as anybody, and I'm
not likely to be long out of a berth. Even if I was,
it wouldn't much matter; for, not being a fool, like
Townes, I haven't got a wife and six children to keep,
and I've been able to put by money.</p>

<p>One of those Townes children walked back with me
as I came from my work to-day. It was the one they
call Hilda. She's a pretty enough child, but nothing
like what Townes thinks. The way that man talks
about them, as if they were a set of angels, makes me
laugh. Thank God, I've none of my own to make a
fool of myself about. It's lucky for Townes, too, that
I'm not a married man, for otherwise I should have
had the lodge and he wouldn't, and the lodge is a lot
better than anything he could afford out of his wages.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>About half-past eight to-night Townes came round
to the cottage to see me, and pulled out a rabbit from
under his coat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know whether you'd care about anything
in this way, Mr Adam," he said. "It's a nice fat
young rabbit."</p>

<p>"Where did you get that, Townes?" I said.</p>

<p>He gave a sheepish kind of grin. "Well," he
said, "there's plenty of them about, aren't there?
I count they're more a pest than anything else.
Anyway, one rabbit more or less won't matter to
'em up at the House. It's not as if rabbits were
game."</p>

<p>"I don't know nothing about that, Townes, and I
don't care nothing, either. I won't have it. As
you've got it, you'd better take it back to your wife;
and if I find you getting any more, you'll get the sack
as sure as my name's Stephen Adam."</p>

<p>"All right, Mr Adam," he said. "That shall be
as you say, of course. I thought perhaps, rabbits not
coming into your province, you wouldn't mind. Then
I wanted to call round too, to say how much obliged
I am to you."</p>

<p>"What for?" I said.</p>

<p>"About those melons. There was a holy row
about it, wasn't there? I don't deny it. You told
me yourself to shut those lights, and I said I would.
How I came to miss it I can't think. Something or
other must have got into my head."</p>

<p>"It's a pity, Townes, that a bit of sense don't get
into your head sometimes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, there it was, anyhow. We heard the
governor laying into you about it, and not a word did
you say about it's being anybody's fault but your
own. Of course the governor thinks a lot of you, and
he'd put up with a thing in you which he'd give me
the sack for right off. Still, I do take it as being very
kind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can hold your tongue, Townes. I've got
no kindness for such as you&mdash;wasting hours of skilled
work by your damned wool-gathering forgetfulness."</p>

<p>"The fact of the case is that I'd got that child
Hilda a bit on my mind at the time. The missus
thought she was sickening for the measles."</p>

<p>"Well, she wasn't. What would it have mattered
if she had been? All children have the measles,
don't they? Do you think yours have got to be so
blessed superior? That's no excuse at all. As for
the kindness, it was simply justice. If I choose to
give an order to an idiot, then it's only fair that I
should suffer for it."</p>

<p>"I don't know that I've forgotten much before, Mr
Adam."</p>

<p>"No, my boy, you haven't. And you'd better not
forget much again if you want to keep your place.
Just you let it be a lesson to you. And if you must be
the father of six squalling brats, keep 'em out of your
mind during work-hours. The truth is, Townes,
that you think too much of those children of yours.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
I'm sure I don't know what they'll come to. You'll
spoil 'em. Your own wife told me only the other day
that you spoilt 'em."</p>

<p>Townes gave that stupid grin of his again. "Anyhow,"
he said, "I don't go buying chocolates for 'em
in the village."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "you can get about your business.
I want to read my paper, and I'm not one of those
that sit up half the night."</p>

<p>I wonder if Hilda told him about those sweets, or if
he found her eating them and then guessed. It was a
fool of a thing for me to do, and I shan't do it again.
That's the way you lose your authority over the men
under you, by being a bit too familiar, and then of
course they shirk their work and you get blamed for
it.</p>

<p>The governor was pretty civil to-day, and after all,
I don't know as I want to change at my time of life.
There's a lot of half-finished work about the place still
and some of it'll take a long time to get exactly to my
liking.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I can't make things out. We did a lot better than
we expected at the Horticultural, and the governor
behaved handsomely by me, as he always does. But
he's not as cheerful as usual. I see him wandering
about the garden by himself, just as if he'd got something
on his mind. He's sold his hunters, and I want<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
to know what for. It's given out that he finds he's
getting too old for it. Looks to me more like something
in the cutting-down way. I had a word with
the cook up at the House, and she's of the same way
of thinking. It's not only the hunters. She says
there's less ordered and less entertaining done, and
one of the maids has been turned off. If he's lost
money, I wonder how he's lost it. It's not betting
or gambling, for he was never that sort. I should say
it was some investment gone wrong. I'm glad I took
my father's advice there and put my savings into
Consols. It may not bring in much, but the money
is always there. The fact of the case is that these
gentlefolk never ought to touch business at all.
There are plenty of solicitors and such to look after it
for them. A gentleman isn't meant to do anything
except amuse himself, and when he interferes with
other things he is going out of his station in life and
acting foolishly. This is particularly the case when
a gentleman tries to talk as if he knew anything about
gardening. I was looking round the place to-day,
and I should be sorry to leave it&mdash;in fact, I doubt if I
should be able to make myself comfortable anywhere
else. Three weeks ago, when there was that row
about the melons, I did think of going. But that was
a fit of temper, and with me a fit of temper's soon
over. I believe I'd sooner work for half the wages
than go. And if the governor says anything to me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
about cutting down, I don't know as I shan't hint at
something of the kind. He's cut down in the stable
and in the house, and it won't surprise me if the
garden has the next turn. I may be wrong. He's
always very keen about his garden, and I fancy he'd
as soon spend money on that as anything.</p>

<p>Had to give that fool Townes a bit of the rough
side of my tongue. I found one of his children, the
one they call Hilda, up on Sunley Hill, and they've
got measles in those cottages there, as he well knows.
Of course he had to make his excuse. He couldn't
always be looking after them, and there were such a
lot of them, and he knew his missus was hard at it all
day. That last part's true. I had to promise that
child Hilda something if she wouldn't go Sunley Hill
way any more, but it's all against my better judgment.
What I ought to have done was to have
given her a good dressing-down and frightened her
a bit. Seems a queer thing that a man who knows
how to handle men and keep them in their place
shouldn't know how to treat a child. All I can say is
that it's the last time I shall make that mistake.
Otherwise I don't know that I can say much against
Townes. He's at his work smart and early every
morning, which is what I like; and he doesn't loiter
about. I hate a man who stands like a statue, with
one foot on his spade, when he thinks nobody is looking
at him. What's more, he takes a real interest in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
his work. He's not an educated man, as I am, and
he's never had my advantages, but I will say for him
that he's as willing to learn as anybody can want.
In fact, I sometimes wonder if I'm not spoiling my
own game by teaching him a bit too much. I must
be on the lookout about that.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It's just exactly what I thought. One of Townes'
kids has got the measles. It's the one they call
Hilda; and that's a very stupid name, to my mind,
to give to the daughter of a working gardener. Of
course Townes is about half off his head, and that's
a bad thing, for he never had too much sense at any
time. I told him yesterday, as I've told him before,
that all children have measles, and the sooner they
have 'em the sooner it's over, and the better it is
every way. Then he says the child's rare bad, and
the doctor wouldn't come twice a day if he didn't
think so. As I told him, the doctor comes twice a
day to make his bill a bit bigger. I suppose doctors
are on the make, same as gardeners and everybody
else. Why wasn't Townes in any club? He says
he shall be now. He's always shutting the stable
door after he's lost the horse. That's the way things
happen. I've been in a club for years, and never
had any occasion for a doctor at all. I looked in at
the lodge yesterday to give Hilda what I had promised,
having first of all found out that she had kept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
her word and had not been up to Sunley Hill again.
Otherwise I shouldn't have gone in. As it was, it
was of no use, as she was too bad to eat what I'd
brought, and was a bit light-headed. She didn't
seem to recognise me; and, queerly enough, that was
almost a kind of disappointment. I felt quite angry
with the child. As she couldn't take what I'd promised,
and I found there were one or two other little
things that were wanted, I got them instead. I believe
in acting fairly by everybody, even if it's only
one of Townes' brats. I went in again to-day, and this
time she knew me. That speaks for itself, and shows
that she must be getting better. I've had the
measles myself or I wouldn't have taken the
risk.</p>

<p>Had to complain to Townes to-day about his half
starving himself. He said that he'd had a good deal
of expense lately, and money was a bit short, and he
had to save where he could. I told him, as I've told
him twenty times, not to act like a fool. If a man
doesn't eat, he can't work. If a man is paid to work,
and doesn't work, he's swindling his boss. As I'm
here to see, amongst other things, that Townes
doesn't swindle the governor, I had to make some sort
of an arrangement with him. I've told him we'll
settle about the interest later. Strictly speaking, I
ought to make it pretty stiff, for Townes isn't Consols
by a long way. Now I'll go off for a stroll and my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
evening pipe. Possibly I may look in at the lodge.
In that case I think I'll leave the pipe till afterwards,
as the child may not like it.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>That brat of Townes' is better&mdash;ever so much
better. In another week she'll be about, all over the
place, and worrying the life out of me, same as usual.
I did get a little peace and quietness when she was ill.
Townes, of course, is as pleased as Punch, but I very
soon knocked that out of him. I asked him how he
thought he was going to support his children when
they were a bit bigger on the wages that he got. I
told him he was fit to be a head-gardener now, and
asked him if he was content to be second all his life.
He said, as things were at present, he didn't like to
chuck a sure thing for what was only a chance. He's
got no more enterprise than a dead dog. That's the
curse of children. They hang round you like a dead
weight, and you never get on at all. Thank Heaven,
I've none of my own.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I will say this for myself, that I can generally foresee
what's going to happen. I'm not one of those that
has to look at a newspaper to know what the weather's
going to be. It was the stables first, and then it was
the house, and I said at the time it would be the
garden next. The governor came along to me this
morning with a sort of melancholy smile on his face,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
and talked to me just as openly and frankly as if I'd
been a gentleman like himself.</p>

<p>"Adam," he said, "I've lost a lot of money lately.
Been swindled out of it. I daresay you heard?"</p>

<p>"I'd heard nothing definite, sir. I'm sure I'm
very sorry to hear it now."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "what I came to tell you is that
you'll have to get along with one man less in the
garden. I think Green will be the one to go."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," I said, "I don't know if I might
venture on a suggestion."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I was going to say that Green's wages don't
amount to very much in the year, not as compared
with mine. If I might suggest, I think you might
do a lot worse than to let me go and make Townes the
head man here, with, say, a small rise. That'd save
a lot of money, and I know you'd find Townes
satisfactory."</p>

<p>"Does he know enough about it?"</p>

<p>"To speak plainly, by this time he knows as much
about it as I do. He's one of the cleverest and smartest
men I ever had under me, and he's a beggar to
work as well. He's never done one single thing
wrong since he's been here."</p>

<p>"What about yourself, Adam? I thought you
were attached to the place. I didn't think you'd ever
want to leave my service."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, sir, I've been very well suited here. But
then, you see, it all fits in. I could take a rather
bigger place. Before I came here I'd ten men under
me. And I should feel quite comfortable if Townes
was taking on the work, for he knows how things
ought to be done."</p>

<p>So it's all settled. Townes has got a grin on him
that would reach from here to London, and would
keep on thanking me all day if I didn't tell him to
shut his head and get on with his work. I may be
leaving, but so long as I am here I'll see proper order
kept.</p>

<p>That kid of his, the one they call Hilda, isn't
pleased at all. She says that if I go she'll come with
me.</p>

<p>I wish to God she would.</p>

<h2>THE SCENT</h2>


<p>There was no one but myself in the smaller of
the two smoking-rooms when he entered. I
had picked up an evening paper, and was boring
myself with it for a few minutes in front of the fire,
before going on to bore myself somewhere else. He
walked rapidly to the fireplace and rang the bell, and
then turned abruptly to me.</p>

<p>"Hullo! How are you! Didn't know you were
here." Then he caught sight of the evening paper in
my hands and asked me for God's sake to put that
thing down. I put it down and asked him what was
the matter. He was very pale and had just the appearance
of a man whose nerves were suffering from
over-strain.</p>

<p>"I must tell you," he said abruptly. "I'm glad
I found you. It's the most perfectly&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped there because the waiter who answered
the bell had just entered. He ordered some brandy
and resumed again.</p>

<p>"You will laugh your head off by the time I have
finished my story, ghastly though it is. You won't
believe a word of it. See here."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>He picked up the paper which I had thrown down,
opened it rapidly, and handed it to me with his
finger on one particular paragraph. The paragraph
referred to an inquest on a somewhat commonplace
suicide in Soho. The suicide, an Italian judging by
his name, had flung himself from a window on the
first floor, and had broken his neck on the pavement.
Evidence was given by those who knew him that he
had been very queer in his manners of late, and the
usual verdict had been returned.</p>

<p>"Well?" I said.</p>

<p>"It's God's mercy that I wasn't a witness at that
inquest."</p>

<p>"What does it matter?" I replied. "I suppose
you saw the accident. You are required to go and
say that; it doesn't hurt you. Nobody thinks any
the worse of you. It may be a little tiresome, but
there is nothing to bring you to this condition, even
if you had really given evidence, which it seems you
haven't."</p>

<p>The waiter brought the brandy. He drank it,
ordered another, and continued more quietly.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I have let the thing prey on my mind
a little. I confess that I have had a shock. The
story is not at all what you imagine. I did not
witness the accident; it was only within the last two
hours that I heard of it, but I know how it was that
it happened."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>He paused. I selected another cigar, lit it, and
said nothing. He continued:</p>

<p>"You know me well enough to know my interest
in anything which is a little out of the way. I will
even run some slight risk to meet and talk with a man
who is not as other men are, or, better still, a woman
who is not as other women are. I have a fancy for
human curiosities; I should like to take a museum
and collect them."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "I know that. You will get yourself
into trouble one of these days."</p>

<p>He went on speaking.</p>

<p>"About a week ago I went down Wardour Street
and saw an Italian looking in at a shop window. I
did not know that he was an Italian at the time. The
national characteristics were not very strongly
marked in him. He was quite well dressed, rather
like a well-to-do young City man. His head was
abnormal. The breadth from the end of the eyebrow
to the ear was enormous. His eyes were not
of the same colour; his skin was like parchment; he
continually moved the tip of his nose. His nostrils
opened and shut. He looked to me to be a very
queer beast indeed, and I meant to talk to him.</p>

<p>"After a while he went into a restaurant. I waited
ten minutes and then went in after him. I sat down
at the same table, and, by way of opening a conversation,
knocked over his glass of claret, breaking the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
glass. Then, of course, I apologised and ordered a
waiter to replace it. He at once countermanded the
order, and turned to me, saying in excellent English,
'Pray do not trouble. I had quite finished with it.'</p>

<p>"'But,' I said, 'you must let me. Your glass was
untouched.'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' he said, 'but I never drink it.'</p>

<p>"I looked amazed. 'I could explain,' he added,
'but it is a little difficult to understand, and it would
bore you.'</p>

<p>"'The only things that I care about,' I replied,
'are the things which are not ordinary, and are a
little difficult to understand. Unless you are a dipsomaniac,
triumphing over temptation, I fail to see
why you should order wine which you have no intention
of drinking.'</p>

<p>"'Your explanation is wrong,' he replied. 'I
ordered the claret because I wanted to smell it.'</p>

<p>"As he seemed to find that conclusive, I observed
that even that did not clear the thing up.</p>

<p>"'You must know,' he said a little impatiently,
'that with some people the scents of different objects
have curious results. The possibilities implied in the
sense of smell are enormous. In most people they
are undeveloped; in very few are they at all understood.
The connection between a scent and a memory
has been noticed. I have seen a woman who smelt
wallflowers for the first time for ten years burst into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
tears. The scent of eau de Cologne is supposed to be
refreshing, and that of ammonia to be vivifying, and
that of ether sickening. No scent possesses the very
curious attraction for a human being that valerian
does for the lower animals.'</p>

<p>"'The whole art of obtaining a new sensation by
the use of scents is absolutely unknown to most
people. Most women divide scents vaguely into
opaque and transparent; most virtuous women prefer
the transparent. But that is really as far as they
have gone. As for the effect of those scents which are
not pleasant to anybody, and therefore are generally
called by an unpleasant name, there seems to be no
knowledge at all.'</p>

<p>"'I knew a case,' I said, 'of a gardener who had
to work in a hothouse filled with lilies-of-the-valley.
He fainted away.'</p>

<p>"My Italian friend took up the story.</p>

<p>"'And when he recovered consciousness he was
angry and entreated to be put back again?'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' I said, 'but how did you know it?'</p>

<p>"'Because I know the effect of different scents.'</p>

<p>"I was more fascinated than ever, and made him
talk for a long time. Several times he seemed to
be hesitating whether or not to tell me something,
and I urged him on. It came at last. He had got
a secret. He had invented a scent and was assured
of the marvellous power of it, but not of the whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
of its effects, afterwards or immediate. These he
was investigating. 'And,' he added impressively,
'it gives one an entirely new way of living.'</p>

<p>"'I wish,' I said, 'that you were a poor man
wanting money with which to carry on your experiments.
If I offered to finance you perhaps you would
let me witness some of them. I love nothing better
than to see something new.'</p>

<p>"'I do not want any money,' he answered laughing.
'My workshop is near here, and I will show it
to you if you care to take the risk of coming.'</p>

<p>"'I will come,' I replied, 'with pleasure.'</p>

<p>"And we both walked out together. He took me
up a side-street, and then up a precipitous staircase
to the first floor of a dingy-looking house. He had
three large rooms there, opening into one another.
He made me wait in the first, which was somewhat
poorly furnished as a library, and he went through
into the others. After about ten minutes he came
back and fetched me through the second room, where
a lot of things were cooking over tiny little spirit
lamps, and into the third. The third was furnished
as the first, but it was much more luxurious. He
opened a corner cupboard and took down an ordinary
glass stopper bottle, unlabelled and containing a
colourless liquid.</p>

<p>"'That is it,' he said smiling; 'that is what makes
all things new.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course by this time I knew he was cracked,
but I asked him how.</p>

<p>"'After frequent inhalations of this scent,' he said,
'one loses all sense of limitations or conditions. One
believes that one can walk straight through a brick
wall, or fly in the air, or live in the year one, or in the
year two million, or in any intervening year. One is
sure that he can do anything which it occurs to him
that he would like to do. One has a feeling of complete
omnipotence, and that means a feeling of complete
happiness. No one conscious of a limitation
can be completely happy. At present the effects
are very transient, but I may be able to improve upon
that.'</p>

<p>"'One moment,' I said. 'This scent does not
really remove limitations and conditions.'</p>

<p>"'Subjectively, yes, objectively, no; but that
matters little. Nothing can be unreal to us at the
time that we fully believe it to be real. It is because
the effects are illusive that I now refrain from experimenting
with myself unless there is someone in the
room with me. It is a hard struggle to keep off it.
Frankly, I was very glad when you suggested that
you should come here. Now, watch me.'</p>

<p>"He removed the stopper, and for perhaps two
minutes continued to inhale the perfume. Then he
put the stopper back again in the bottle and set it
down on the table by his side. He did not change<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
in appearance in the least. Half-jokingly I asked
him if he could now write stories like Mr Rudyard
Kipling.</p>

<p>"'Better,' he said, 'infinitely better. They are
nothing. I will show you one very short thing.'</p>

<p>"He took paper, pen and ink, and covered one
sheet with feverish haste. Then he handed it to me
with an air of triumph. It was absolute nonsense
from beginning to end, and absolutely incoherent.
There were phrases in it which we had used in our
conversation, phrases which he might have seen in
advertisements on hoardings, two or three lines of a
song which is very popular just now, the whole strung
together anyhow. I looked over it.</p>

<p>"'Capital,' I said; 'and can you fly?'</p>

<p>"'Of course.' He got up and opened the window.
I let him climb up on the ledge, where a nervous man
would certainly have fallen. I saved him only just
in time, and he was angry with me. As I told him
unfortunately I was not able to fly and wished for his
company, he sat down and talked rubbish about the
things which he said he could do for about five
minutes. Then he stretched himself and yawned.</p>

<p>"'It has passed off now,' he said. I had a long
argument with him, but it was of no use. He would
not give up the bottle and he would not promise to
leave it alone in the future, and he would not tell me
what he called it. To irritate him I said that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
whole thing was a fraud from beginning to end; the
bottle contained water, and nothing else. I picked
it up, took a long sniff at it, and went out.</p>

<p>"In the street a moment later I called a cabman
and told him to drive to Downing Street. I wanted
to show Lord Salisbury the means of destroying any
nation. I had the power of destroying any nation,
and I wished to use it for the benefit of England.
Long before the cab reached Downing Street I also
stretched my arms and yawned, and knew that the
effect had gone off. I drove back to my chambers.</p>

<p>"To-day I read of the suicide. He had tried to
fly and he did it because I suggested it to him when
he was in that state the other day. It was my fault,
really."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>He picked up his second glass of brandy and began
sipping it. He talked it over for a long time, but he
would not contradict himself or be shaken in any way.</p>

<p>It is at any rate perfectly true that at the sale of
the suicide's property he made some large purchases.
I found that out afterwards from the auctioneer.</p>

<p>He is living abroad now.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
